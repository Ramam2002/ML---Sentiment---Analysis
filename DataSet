 family mormon have never tried explain them they still stare puzzled from time time like some kind strange creature nonetheless they have come admire for the patience calmness equanimity acceptance and compassion have developed all the things buddhism teaches ,Positive
buddhism has very much lot compatible with christianity especially considering that sin and suffering are almost the same thing suffering caused wanting things shouldn want going about getting things the wrong way christian this would mean wanting things that don coincide with god will and wanting things that coincide but without the aid jesus buddhism could also seen proof god all mighty will and omnipotence certainly christians are lucky have one such christ there side but what about everyone else well many christians believe god grace salvation and buddhism god way showing grace upon others would also help study the things jesus said and see how buddha has made similar claims such rich man getting into heaven joke basically advocating that should rid ourselves material possessions fact distinctly remembered jesus making someone cry because that someone asked what achieve salvation and jesus replied with live like buddhist very very roughly translated also point out that buddha rarely spoke anything about god theory personally because knew well enough leave that jesus and mohamed who came later just remember conflict difference opinion but education can fun involving and enlightening easier teach something than prove right like intelligent design ,Positive
seriously don say thing first all they won get its too complex explain normal people anyway and they are dogmatic then doesn matter what you say see mechante post and for any reason you decide later life move from buddhism and that doesn suit you identity though you still get keep all the wisdom then your family will treat you like you went through weird hippy phase for while there didncha and you never hear the end pro tip don put one these your wall jpg ,Negative
what you have learned yours and only yours what you want teach different focus the goal not the wrapping paper buddhism can passed others without word about the buddha ,Neutral
for your own benefit you may want read living buddha living christ thich nhat hanh you might find any subsequent discussions with your loved ones easier you are able articulate some the parallels that exist between buddhism and christianity don surprised they react negatively for having lost you treat them with compassion and deserved understanding although they may indeed display signs being hurt your new path properly sharing with them way that may alleviate their fear something they may perceive wrong the very least alien their beliefs may help allowing them the long run accept although not necessarily agree with your decision regardless where they end you have make your own way ,Positive
you should all sit down together and watch the simpsons episode where lisa becomes buddhist simpsons season episode she little faith then discuss ,Negative
 was teens when discovered zen meditation was then undiagnosed bpd being homeschooled and just gotten 56k modem with web connection where came across link zen meditation tried for couple weeks and the change was palpable felt the most profound sense peace ever felt grades immediately started going had more energy started martial arts just huge positive change all around parents asked something was wrong fundie parents when anything changes this was where naiveté kicked foolishly told them been trying meditation and really calmed down thought they happy that found something that helped but never forget what happened next mother affected this mockingly calm breathy voice she said you can pretend calm and happy all you want but without jesus you never content was that moment that any belief had christian faith all vanished completely realized that she had probably never been happy ever have never felt profoundly sorry for someone did for her that moment ,Positive
jesus was zen meets jew ,Neutral
there are two varieties christians dogmatic that dwell words and conservative that take heart the spirit the teachings hate oversimplify things but helps this understanding you are discussing with dogmatic religious people who live the letter the law will uphill battle wish you luck you are discussing with moderates exchange idea should come fairly easily comparing contrasting also discussing parallel teachings presented differently wouldn out the ordinary they may give you relevant spiritual advice even though you are not believer their religion ,Negative
dont worry about trying explain yourself just meditate regularly and try hard you can more aware everything else will follow coming from someone who has been throught his situation welcome pms ,Positive
 recently told family that buddhist live the bible belt this whole ordeal involved leaving the baptist church and everything been pretty rough but those who really care about have been open and accepting they seen the good has created life and relationships with others fact there are handful christians who have lovely conversations with and that truly respect someone else suggested living buddha living christ great one read about the important dialogue between buddhists and christians also welcome you message ,Positive
 unto others you would have them unto you would good start ,Positive
first understand that you are not anyway control how they will react always find that any subject better understood first learning the vocabulary explain what the word buddha means most people believe buddhists praise worship and follow guy named buddha christians due jesus let them know that one could both buddhist and christian with conflict the teachings and the messages jesus are indeed buddhist philosophy jesus became enlightened buddha and realized that had become annointed being christ then continue with your practice and let them work out their own issues that advice all the best ,Positive
 recently heard similar question where person asked they should introduce meditation his loved ones who had challenges coping with problems life the answer from the lama was quite interesting instead giving people advice one should focus his practice that way others will see the change and maybe even ask about personally think better keep yourself even though you must really excited about you can also keep dharma books around the house and sure people will pick them for quick browse when you are not looking learn bit about other people traditions well browsing through books they owned ,Positive
different times different cultures same point they were trying get across jesus said god has beginning nor end buddha said mind was never born and has never died just replace the word meditation with prayer and couting the breath with the name jesus and everyone happy,Positive

our campaign has two suns one pelor the other shamedan pelor the god all know and find bit stifling really shamedan the sun desert the burning sun who will kill you without mercy even second though shamedan brings drought and brings the fire that destroys all you own generally not very nice has race fey called desert hags who worship him and have radiant and fire resistance but they haven played nearly much part the campaign they should have ,Positive

 always liked vecna the one time was able use him story had blast playing the fact that was far not the most powerful deity but was one the most dangerous due his portfolio but favorite pale night who technically not deity but close enough guess most the abyssal lords and the rulers the nine hells are fairly straightforward and have ample backstory but her lack thereof just intriguing ,Positive
though don have any good suggestions for additional deities the moment you should probably have some overlap the cavern dwelling gnolls might consider pelor the god evil blinding them with his wicked light loki has sufficiently fooled them over the years into thinking their benefactor always leading them the bountiful crops they steal from the peasantry they have statues him fat woman giving out food the starving they view the god death the god justice giving righteous end those gnolls that have served brutal conflicts point view can change everything ,Negative
 cliche but you can wrong with cyric mean was mortal who just nabbed all when got the chance you gotta respect that ,Negative
zon kuthon and his sister shelyn good deity have really cool story from the pathfinder setting plus off topic pathfinder has the coolest good deity ever cayden cailean was bard that got wasted one night stumbled into the temple the star stone artifact that can turn you into deity and woke the next morning with hangover memory the night before and godly powers ,Positive
 homebrew setting the primary lawful evil deity named for friend lewie essentially has three domains tyranny law applied without mercy vengeance and community the idea being that cruel and harsh god but also recognizes that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar thus his church often the most benevolent toward the common people day day basis the running gag that lewian churches sponsor more inner city basketball teams than any other major faith you probably want change the name but might make interesting dynamic within your setting ,Negative

for one campaign pretty much just snatched the chaos god nurgle lord plague from the whfb wh40k universe renamed him narghull was nar ghull can remember random apostrophes are always nice though the campaign revolved around his cult trying wake the god from sleep that had lasted 1000 years but sadly stalled very lazy this was back was never meant encountered directly meaning never worked out any stats anything basically works spread plague and other diseases and pretty damn evil think ,Negative

 far evil goes big fan shar from the forgotten realms setting the god ultimate despair loss and suffering you know god evil when followers don even bother asking for small boons but instead invoke suffering themselves and others hopes that those events will enough prevent the god from needing get involved personally bringing suffering into the world shar isn one those pansy goddesses evil where you might get nod appreciation for sacrifice with shar you better kill somebody damn near ever day and you get nothing and like with check out the dogma here ,Negative
 like the idea prometheus giving magic the pcs however think that prometheus should more like demi god and that the reason why gives the magic mortals prometheus could jealous the fact that the gods have all the powers and they granted him only half status upon his creation thus his revenge giving humanity order turn the tides power among deities and mortals furthermore perhaps the repercussion prometheus feels from his action being dragged the underworld cerberus making him seem less than deity like and more mortal inhuman order face judgment from egyptian goddess morals virtue and judge the dead ,Positive
pelor the burning hate also hextor boss god tyranny and conquest always fun think one the books there god lawyers too ,Negative
wee jas lawful neutral god death magic and necromancy not evil god but perfect representation the inevitable things which mortals fear while other evil gods make plans which may thwarted wee jas merely waits all shall come her the end also playing cleric her fabulous fun ,Positive
zen master bassui said when the functioning analytical consciousness destroyed feelings are purified this referred the pure land the west you truly want know the meaning being born the pure land you must first know the master who born this land the physical body has never from its inception been the true body but rather temporary formation the five aggregates after the four elements disperse what remains called the self the self originally empty what that born the pure land there master born the pure land what that seeks this land bliss just extinguish the ever seeking mind rid thoughts and attachment form and the body consisting the four elements will have individual self when there individual mind the nature mind and there aspect disorder ,Positive
pure land other power opposed the usual self power taught most buddhist schools though the pure land here and now and not some other dimension the afterlife ,Positive
there are many flavours buddhism pure land ideas are not common all them however the important thing realize doesn really matter that the big difference compared the abrahamic religions buddhism not dogmatic the sense bunch things that must taken literally else you are non believer sinner whatever maybe pure land ideas work for you great maybe they don great what works for you works for you what doesn work useless you the historical buddha himself taught dramatically different styles suit his audience parables and metaphors are just that the point where they take you not literally believing them literally and physically true zen koans are good example this very purely distilled most are the form stories but not stories you are believe physically happened you are reading history book that entirely irrelevant what the story does you that the point you are wondering did this really happen does this place really exist you are missing that point also worth noting that most things are about psychological phenomenon not physical phenomenon personally find this makes buddhist cosmology much easier understand than considering competitor physical cosmology they not conflict they just about different cosmos ,Positive
 going try comment this simply can gets metaphysical and some may even say supernatural but hope you can try maintain open mind enough for help with your understanding everything that physical everything that exists the universe and beyond are created the power the mind exercised through consciousness mara created the samsara worlds planes dimensions that may experience joy sadness love heartbreaks etc this was done through his her its focus the mind and streams consciousness began attracted these worlds planes dimensions and begin develop craving for existence and thus begins the cycle rebirth the pure lands buddhism were created the focus the mind amitabha buddha way help individuals attain enlightenment their own pace amitabha buddha understood that the attraction emotions sex love and existence can overwhelming for normal individuals overcome within one lifetime 100 years average for human beings other beings much shorter and yet others much longer created the pure lands the west place refuge and practice for those who call upon his name sincerely this place not metaphorical state mind while these individuals are earth for lack better word real though not necessarily physical the way feel physical things via the electromagnetic repelling force electrons this world certain laws physics are applicable that world land plane dimension whatchamacallit certain laws physics not apply and yet newer laws superphysics would also the rule there that not the law our world now having been carried this land doesn mean that the individuals are guaranteed enlightenment first they still need cultivate themselves while there enlightenment not given dependant every single individual consciousness efforts shed the fetters samsara anger ignorance and jealousy and embrace the noble truths they may choose rejoin the samsaric worlds again and back into the cycle rebirth but least they have the option stay and cultivate themselves the pure land the west that would the main difference between the abrahamic idea heaven against the amitabha buddha pure lands the west hope this helps ,Positive
 think your characterization pure land isn that far off there reason not that popular among westerners odd abandon christianity judaism and take pure land because first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma but now seems much leap faith the abrahamic religions least the pure land sect most forms buddhism have some sort supernatural element some orthodox believers might deny that just like some christians might attempt make scientific arguments for the world being 6000 years old the very least you have rebirth and different planes that includes devas zen seems have the least reverence for dogma which why popular the west the other western strategy assume things are meaningful figuratively and not literally but yeah buddhism religion the end the day for most its followers ,Positive
most religions have dogmatic orthodox well esoteric philosophic side the christian heaven can seen palace the clouds state mind rebirth buddhism can seen fact just superstition left over from other beliefs you interpret and understand you see fit like think about various religions talking about the same thing using different words and yes cherry pick what believe but honestly and very carefully think better than taking everything religion says and rejecting everything doesn say there must hundred different ways talk about enlightenment heaven pure land individuation alchemy rites passage education trials meditation the tricky part that what describes can easily explained words and most importantly has understood which different than just knowing reading about the pure land real place state mind doubt real place but sure some will believe buddhism has some dogma but not nearly much eastern religions ,Positive
you won find one answer your question but the pure land state mind perspective reality not separate place let quote thich nhat hanh human beings our deepest desire find environment which secure and where there love and understanding all want live such environment you live surroundings where you feel there security understanding and love and where people have the capacity transform their suffering fear and attachment then you live the pure land from finding our true home this isn leap faith all because you have already been the pure land but momentarily every time you bring the buddha mind fully then you are said the pure land imagine because you enter that state some degree this not matter faith but expanding upon what you know joyful experience quite different the abrahamic religions concept heaven which eschatological reality rather than gnostic one will add that there course are some who believe the pure land totally separate paradise however there are positive ways understanding this when the state mind another rebirth will seem like such foreign reality that may well different place entirely ,Positive
 first impressions buddhism was that was devoid dogma isn good thing about buddhism least for outsider that much easier pick and choose what parts you not want use see dogma kind environment habitat for the profound and useful ideas develop all religions have something useful buddhist religions and not just one homogeneous buddhism just seem have something that more relevant and powerful the context our culture ,Positive
from limited knowledge the pure land not paradise but place contemplation stepping off point where you are given the knowledge leave the cycle suffering and rebirth anything more akin the now defunct catholic idea purgatory than actual heaven ,Positive
 response your question about how amitabha created the pure land this quote from the article pure land buddhism wikipedia the longer sukhāvatīvyūha sūtra the buddha begins describing his attendant ānanda past life the buddha amitābha states that past life amitābha was once king who renounced his kingdom and became bodhisattva monk named dharmākara dharma storehouse under the guidance the buddha lokeśvararāja world sovereign king innumerable buddha lands throughout the ten directions were revealed him after meditating for five eons bodhisattva then made great series vows save all sentient beings and through his great merit created the realm sukhāvatī ultimate bliss this land sukhāvatī would later come known the pure land chinese translation important remember that buddhism has been around for thousands years and that for long time buddhists didn have telescopes big machines scan the brain with his holiness the dalai lama himself has said that the discoveries science and the teachings buddhism contradict then the discoveries science are correct this video tgv1gwvrz one the major teachings the buddha was test out each his teachings oneself order see they were true rather than taking his word faith without proof however course just man who has seen mountain some remote region where one has not traveled may believed until the distance that region crossed might have some sort faith buddhist teachings since the people doing the teachings have often devoted their whole lives the teachings the buddha ,Positive

the discussion about the rat ended concluding won work because you will naturally headbutt the rat death minotaur might work with another race though trog wrath very very very difficult survive you have boots levitation and lots food you might able hover over lava deep water won help summons giant sized creatures other than that tomb card might work you have your stash food not sure you not using shield you might well switch two handed axe from experience anti magic isn that great with brand fire you can generally kill things faster use holy versus liches and other undead casters and also kill them faster ,Positive
 could swear they lowered trog wrath just got extremely lucky because recently tried make the switch kobe and was not difficult all just took food ring and some perma food and carved out two space area near the the summons were actually not the worst part the worst got was berserk hill giant and the vast majority were just berserk bears for the worst part was actually the rotting since happened least times and never caught right away while spamming rest,Negative
for the love gods don the abyss until trog wrath over none your teleport blink panic buttons work lost handful very promising mibes this way ,Positive
 when and how supposed swap tso and branch order from there basically you switch immediately before entering crypt clear crypt max tso piety then holy brand your best weapon your case that executioners axe and off you post endgame branch order like whatever theres strict order like there the early game whichever branch you feel best prepared for how avoid meeting terrible fate the hands trog wrath you have book with blink soon you leave trog train transloc little bit that you can cast then whenever surrounds you with berserking enemies you can blink out the middle them and run staircase teleport you can keep scrolls blinking hand for this purpose but feel more secure also having the spell trog wrath includes fire miscasts that burn all your shit see trick with going lair and having rat block you off but this still viable you can the rat shield thing with most combos but its tedious and unnecessary and your case the minotaur retaliatory headbutt would kill the rat anyway its not option antimagic axe that carry around viable for use all since strictly one handed should train shields use with since have shield reflection could use not really war axes arent very good and while has fantastic selection resists does little damage that its not practical choice weapon against any tough monster wouldnt forgo the damage output weapon use physical shield shields arent very good for melee allruners and therse always tsos divine shield ability you want reflection isnt good shield brand plus its double not good for tso worshiper you reflect poison projectile and hits something you will incur penance for use poison ,Positive
 brother trog very wrathful indeed but his will destroy you neither endless nor inevitable going take the route many will find the easy way out and say that getting past trog your level trivial his wrath dangerous out the open but when you are able choose the area diluted mere timesink what you must grab your closest disintegration wand and cut two diagnols into the wall this will allow you only view one other tile time this point you simply need make sure you have good chunks permafood pip two and then either drop your scrolls wear conservation that point you just spam rest and then tab every time trog has tantrum minotaur your power should have trouble killing his summons after long while you will get message saying has calmed down then you are free worship that damned tso trog wrath your level probably one the least dangerous things you can spend your time dealing with you are willing cheese ,Positive
 were you slime zot except for the orb chamber and blade hopefully you find some better armour you really want good executioner axe before you convert well the okay but could better you really need wearing plate gda something heavier you have more than abandoned trog with level mibe and found pretty trivial the berserked stone giants weren terribly difficult and cleared tomb and most all hells while under trog wrath but somewhat wary trying this with your low and weak weapon you could try waiting out but takes thousands and thousands turns very boring one handed axes suck use executioner axe ,Positive
 have currently rune mibe right now and abandoned trog then immediately cleared crypt max piety and enchant executioner axe then threw caution the winds and cleared pan and hells while under trog wrath was tricky but doable make sure you have curing potions that time was strong enough take out trog summons all sides problem worked but could have died with worse luck ,Positive
 your stage you should strong enough take the berserk summons have the resources escape out them retreat corridor and take them one one quaff curing heal rot would also recommend you get plate armour better asap for the and guaranteed damage reduction also wield the biggest axes you can find kill things faster ,Positive
 you max armour dodging and shields for tso divine shield then the berserkers are joke can wipe them even when fully surrounded and only lose health even with armour and dodging they won give you much trouble ,Negative
ewwww why are you using broad axe get real weapon bet trog gave you good battleaxe exec axe something splint get plate armour better trog wrath will completely destroy char with such poor defenses ,Positive

lets say modi has attributes abcxyz people who like him like him for abcx people who don like him and despise him lot for cxyz that people who like him like him for different reasons than the reasons for which people hate him this why the whole confusion and cacophony opinions when person who trying understand the landscape modi has huge popularity among nris and india which don really understand why his abc characteristics for which liked much his supporters are his economic and growth policies and his pro hindutva ala pat robertson bill reilly style christian conservatism political stance his xyz characteristics for which hated much his opponents his association with gujarat riots during 2002 his state suffered through terrible riots between hindus and muslims triggered train full hindu pilgrims allegedly burned muslim mob resulted state wide backlash against muslims and about 1000 muslims died and many many more were displaced india has had his own share riots and usually the ruling leaders aren blamed much but narendra modi hated much because came television and sympathized with the hindu rioters addition there were reports him letting happen despite the controversy over the years modi has enjoyed widespread support his state and won many elections terms personality wise outspoken and has all the leaderish not leadership qualities indians desire their leader this year election could quite like 2012 american election where lot more people voted against mitt romney and republicans rather than voted for obama although congress government isn popular bjp runs with polarizing figure like modi then there will people flocking congress government but this does not predict the outcome the election hope that helps ,Positive
 been following reddit for while mainly because how entertaining and sometimes informative the comments various issues are been thinking joining for while and bit the bullet after seeing this thread what has modi done candidate what the gujarat story his many enemies will typically quote various statistics show his state poor light but the problem with statistics they can quoted out context reach the conclusion you want according your agenda gujarat means the most developed state india and does indeed lag behind many social indicators but the fact was doing far worse most these child malnutrition before modi became and speaking indicators rarely will your see article highlighting that gujarat contributes percent india industrial output and percent its exports gujarat has the lowest unemployment rate for indian state and accounts for percent new job creation gujarat has 100 percent rural electrification with power supply over 000 villages which has been boon not only for small scale industries but also farmers gujarat has agricultural sector growth percent against the national average percent gujarat known for great road network connecting the above 000 villages well well managed public transportation system gujarat known for relatively low corruption levels and higher efficiency police and government this has been helped governance and policing initiatives general getting things done much faster gujarat than the average for indian governments tata got its nano plant approved matter days rather than months years complaints about roads infrastructure etc are generally dealt with quickly there more but this should for start and typing out this much gleaned from various online and gujarati sources some reddit itself afraid already established myself moditard and will probably the immediate target all manner criticism ,Positive

from someone who has been gujarat while travelling various places some years back still remember the clean lane highways windmills everywhere the both sides the roads and the scenic beauty top that development total coherence with nature preservation was just small naive boy then though your dismay and mine those windmills and solar cell arrays are still hold rajasthan iirc the state things hopeless with the increasing thefts inox wind 150 crore the authorities don give fuck except looking for their cut and the private companies say they can install the machinery with these thefts going and its 2013 now compare that with gujarat also someone can confirm have heard from friends that any govt official doesn see your queries complaints within specific period time you can directly approach the modi its that simple try contacting mayawati ,Positive
yes has used live vastrapur which was considered lower middle class middle class area the vastrapur lake was developed front eyes changing the entire socio economic fabric that place within years also the will second rbecks visited friends village very small blink and you miss place near himmatnagar and the roads were lanes speaking people the village they told because the roads they could get their produce the cities themselves instead hiring 3rd party transporters have stayed many cities over life time delhi mumbai bangalore gujarat and comparing them all over one life time the changes are surprisingly drastic and saying that development happening all over india does not cut majority this development happening urban areas only but gujarat you can see happening both urban and rural areas,Positive

what were the other policies you discussed not asking for details you gave above just bullet points thx ,Negative
 thought would not understand policy discussions but what you have listed simple good way summarize increase oil production guess that should easy since saw recently that leaders all parties unanimously support this initiative for nominal amount really need this for inclusive development but guess this would need the support state governments too have really retarded regional parties ruling promising states congress has totally failed this aspect hope bjp could turn things around definitely agree especially are way behind electronics market many semiconductor companies have huge non manufacturing sites here iirc intel was supposed usher semiconductor manufacturing early 2005 and they pulled out because these lethargic policy makers not beat dead horse but wish bjp and all parties become serious tackling the silent corruption government especially the regulatory and enforcement boards like law and order environment water totally screwed one family members high ranking official one such board doesn matter which government has been transferred incessantly recently got transferred when got into tussle with opposition party mla industry and the ruling party minister summoned him next week and handed the transfer and top all not even honest does the least that could and that follows court orders god bless the honest officers hope this would change maybe the political discourse that happening among people nowadays will change ,Positive
nice know that thank you ,Positive
its because bjp wants such rules place and its better get done under congress they won get blamed that way ,Positive
" india has been ruined congress and populist schemes the problem with populist schemes that you can make noise you are opposition you instantly branded anti poor another problems once introduced not easy get rid them aap with share leftists and socialist like prashant bhushan yogendra yadav binayak sen etc are more towards congress ideology with added agenda anti corruption compared bjp want see some pro market reforms which will create jobs and get our country
back growth rate another problem have the minority appeasement meeting tauqueer raza and then going defend him aap doing the same things
that congress did third holier than thou attitude they just don accept that there are good non corrupt people all parties lot people from
congress and bjp joined aap and suddenly became non corrupt while they were corrupt their old parties don hate aap don like their ideology and attitude would even vote there was option aap like party with right leaning
economic ideology afaik loksatta one such party but even though stay hyd don have vote here have vote native state ",Negative
long rant from aap supporter answers for all your questions you think that aap the only honest party and arvind some kind messiah arvind says that gadkari corrrupt that you will start running around with pitchforks and torches but ignore the news when gadkari proven innocent arvind says that bjp congress you aaptards being intellectually lazy will just accept gospel truth without asking why are raman singh jaitley shivraj vasundhra modi goa corrupt infact they are some the most honest intelligent and progress driven politicians india since very long time unlike aap bjp actually takes action against part members who act retarded case point jethmalani jaswant reddy kesubhai and many others compare that aap one founding members bhushan hardcore anti nationalist shazia caught accepting bribes even before election action against them defectors are given tickets arvind himself plays mulla appeasing policies numerous times aap just bunch idealist lefties who keep shouting the loudest that all politicians are thieves people being stupid accept the generalising statement and convert aaptards without checking the truth still don necessarily hate aap just think that bjp much better option also that most aap fanbois are just fanbois who can think thing themselves added later also point about aap fans being retards proven the downvote campaign which the resident aaptards downvote all comments after every such post proves point that aaptards are just bunch intellectually empty fanbois even the seems naive with his silly questions ,Positive

 have said time and again most people arent shallow minded like the aaptards think vote single agendas agendas which they know unrealistic and just are plain rhetoric dont blame for not having the tunnel vision that you lot are afflicted with corruption does not mean effective governance rather live corrupt nation but one that provides relatively better governance than honest state that just stagnates you didnt understand what said the previous para that exactly the problem with aaptards and you need expand your political perspective ,Positive
aap the new congress congress issues certificates secularism aap issues honesty anybody who comes from any party and joins congress becomes insta secular similarly all the odd mlas who went from bjp cong aap because they were rejects their own party have become insta honest way just like cong the gangotri indian secularism aap the yamnotri honesty ,Positive
thanks for proving once again that aap supporters are bunch immature bholas having deep rooted casteist and communal views this why easy for congress make fools out you they split their opposition vote and made delhi ungovernable and you stupids fell for their game plan and still haven wisened hahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa troll ,Positive
problem with aap they are like worker union leaders sure they have honest intentions but then again not sure good union leaders would make good mds maybe wrong here but how much will ways aap survive reality still unknown even maharashtra prithviraj chavan was almost forced resign when exposed ajit pawars corruption even helpless what can you expect from others corruption like vicious network intertwined and ingrained into indian society should focus changing society unlike aap dudes who think bringing some law going improve things practically speaking bjp right choice about aap nothing can said how can perform national level ,Positive

great appreciate your efforts and this healthy way debate and criticise opponents not the kind which involves baseless lies rumors and team foreign funding crap tired those now which for some reason bjp followers think more effectice don know who told them that because only pisses off and more damage than good bjp itself and since you mentioned your post and made clear our discussion that corruption the issue for will track this post and engage ina discussion once you address that point because matter what good policy you come with unless you can implement the ground they mean nothing and this why before anything want corruption addressed share with how modi planning fight corruption ,Positive
 hate aap for the other thread points such the routine flip plops appeasement ology positions stated about batla house etc this particularly because aap proclaims basic that others are not sum aap self advertised image and platform their commentary why they have not yet perform nothing about ,Negative

 perhaps they fear they may lose small fraction voter base they either support oppose hopefully they will come with their views soon what think the problem that many individual party members may have personal opinion but they don want say anything against the party lines this just personal view party traditionally with right center views and the fact that they are mum about the supreme court having reverted the decision made the delhi high court fear they agree with but hope they take stance soon not having opinion all the worst stance for any political party especially issues relating human rights 377 homosexuality any other especially when party has strong candidate running for ,Negative
 critical issue nice priorities bro for the record fully endorse the repealing the archaic law which needlessly protrudes into the bedrooms consenting adults but dont get carried away except tiny tiny minority urban centers one gives shit this issue ,Negative
 the only problem will take years show its effects society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit ” the fact that the bjp manifesto which honestly could just bunch populist bullshit promotes long range initiatives reason itself optimistic about bjp led future years isn that long reality but the mind indian politician parliament election cycles ,Positive
 really have very little issue with bjp economic policies think they have the clearest agenda among big parties more concerned with the social aspects their agenda they also are doing terrible job the opposition and are known pretty corrupt ,Negative
 like bjp should put this their manifestos anyway least the middle class and the business community will find attractive please continue you have more one suggestion read trade magazine some time ago about how employees maruti factory were striking for wages the tune whopping lakh illustrated how our labor laws had driven salaries unsustainably high many manufacturing sectors and stymied india efforts become manufacturing hub how even bangladesh was having more success than this regard fact this why many indian manufacturers seem hire disproportionately high percentage contract labourers work their factories they don have pay them the same high rates from this would say labor reform and reducing the power unions something else that needs considered the hidden policies that are wait ,Positive

why should bjp say anything there law has amended scrapped the government can introduce the new law parliament and depending the new law bjp can choose support not the problem posted the other thread day back most people are misunderstanding that the article 377 against homosexuals covers wide range issues and the foundation for other laws also makes lot heterosexual acts unlawful including general terms blowjob and anal sex you read and understand the entirety the law then you will understand that doesn mention homosexuals and applied against them should the law scrapped sure but before that see that since this the only law that covers sodomy guess india will also need laws covering rape male female another male also not sure the new rape laws 2013 protect male child not coz they not then this the only law per understanding which can use punish the criminal law not against homosexuals applied against them can applied against heterosexuals also scrap but create new laws first replace this law someone from the legal fraternity can ama and answer our questions about article 377 and rape abuse laws india will great clearing the misinformation ,Positive
politically would stupid move take stand right before the elections maybe that the reason,Negative
 would like bjp come out support scrapping sec 377 but won expect them make comment this because there are lot religious organizations which are against scrapping 377 and support bjp there might loss support bjp takes stance this close national elections might not work well bjp does not have presence many states would not like alienate whatever support has other parts meenakshi lekhi pointed out her tweets this ruling doesn make any difference the act between consenting adults neither them will file fir police won come checking around your bedroom see what you are upto just that will illegal act eyes law congress the other hand has come support scrapping this law openly this spite asg arguing for the law guess congress knows won forming the next government any stand takes issues won hurt them much ,Negative

politics 101 country that medieval minded the one hand and seeks 21st century capitalistic interests the other ,Negative
let put forward some problems and issues the first problem solved define sodomy and what acts are included presently blowjobs anal sex etc are illegal for everyone the major question arises whether allow fucking the assholes yes then should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well lesbians having sex fine until they are not really penetrating anything you would wonder then how could called sex but they wish use sex toys for the same they are not allowed owning selling producing sex toys banned india sex toys are allowed india again the question arises should allowed just between homosexual interactions among heterosexual ones well even the act sex needs defined the present definition wont stand the point does not affect single law affects plenty laws commenting the issue would mean lot things and believe unless someone has clear idea what other effects that might have the existing laws she should refrain from commenting its good supporting opposing something but doing without knowledge inappropriate ,Positive
critical issue lol one cares ,Positive
this would issue these people were prosecuted under 377 and thrown jail tbn and9gctljwbsdyreogwxjxqaeakwn eauxr95fn6ylsdimxltrmsi3lh jpg jpg pride15 jpg agree that the article joke which also criminalizes heterosexual oral anal sex however practice person only charged one the individual not adult the act committed without consent yeah archaic law that needs but doesn harm anybody hence political party stance the issue irrelevant ,Negative

 hate the aap because has absolutely real plans about improving the country situation corruption can only agenda for long there are problems this country more important and more destructive than corruption and the aap instead focusing them actually tries fuel those fires what will they when there some actual work done their delhi manifesto only shows promises they can hope meet irrelevant feel good policies that absolutely nothing for the country and the jan lokpal bill defeating corruption doesn automatically fix all the problems our country just like adding doesn result also disagree with the method they use defeat corruption they completely sideline development which instrumental and perhaps the only way about reducing corruption and instead focus doling out freebies limiting their exposure lower rung corruption and blaming other parties their daft policies are second reason not support them free electricity lower classes and reduction its price fixing vegetable prices have you learned nothing from the congress mistakes basic economics laal batti what the point that again your mlas will the only ones reach parliament half hour after assembly commences half salary for ministers this isn corruption bait the aap hasn single policy that makes iota sense the self righteousness displayed kejriwal and his goons worse than the emotional outbursts modi supporters the internet just watch any debate and cringe kumar vishwas yogender yadav throw unsubstantiated statements well accusations the bjp don care about the congress not going there they act though fighting against corruption the only reason for man descent from trees and thus are quick name the bjp and congress being the same without shred reason related either the stark differences their style governance the prosperity the states they govern and the level contentment within the people those states the fact that arvind kejriwal himself hasn proven his administrative skills and isn likely considering the fact that they hesitant about creating government delhi you know that thing they stood the elections dismissed them easily they dismiss the notion having agendas besides corruption ,Positive

 just small party with noble goals their ideology seems bit muddled and bit too idealistic lots parties start out like this lot things their initial manifesto seemed very poorly thought out maybe that has changed but ultimately just like every other election there will mostly hung parliament and leadership will decided horse trading with shifty state level parties mamata jayalalitha mulayam singh cpm karunanidhi etc etc this one the things that holds progress back frankly whether bjp aap bjp power the country will the shitter really wonder how people think otherwise just look the last years after independance people really think regime change has huge effect anything for example home state west bengal had regime change the party tmc came power with huge promises barely see any difference honest think both the cpm and tmc are awful when power changes hands move from set thugs another not really strongly pro any party highly doubt any party will easily fix corruption india generally very jingoistic very young and strongly influenced peer groups facebook twitter media lot people here are right leaning and pro hinduism very small community and not really the kind place where you will find ton debate topics like this will generally very polarized generally don discuss politics with people since just reflection their adherence group think ,Positive

this very good stuff thank you for taking the time post here all the points you raised and the discussion points this thread have with government investment know this necessary but not the full picture there needs very strong emphasis removing excessive laws and regulation take your point raising revenues for the government you have listed five but there unthinkably large number activities people could only starting and running businesses didn involve interacting government officials second third tier towns the government can just provide basic services roads water internet millions small business owners could relocate out choked cities and spur local growth the opportunities are endless consider the city mysore under the classification the five would pretty much fall squarely under tourism but the government could give better power more reliable communications and better roads bangalore could very easily transformed into hub the revenues that come out the ecosystem will far exceed any the original five categories ,Positive
 see aap followers are conspicuous their abscence here the ideas seen here make you uncomfortable don want reminded kerjiwal non existent plans for economic revival and repairing the damage wrought the upa don like hearing good solutions that the aap can provide ,Positive
 this because import our oil needs and produce just and trade deficit makes matters worse depreciates the value rupee yeah only partly what about the indian oil prospecting companies that are allowed sell indian drilled oil indians international rates there are huge profit margins the wells reliance and vedanta this national resource that few people are being allowed profit from ,Negative

 seems that they are taking congress too html vishwas believed keen fighting from rahul gandhi constituency amethi had earlier said have applied for lok sabha ticket from amethi and the committee will decide this html robert vadra issue there because involves famous person the fact everything like this happens everyday haryana certificate change land usage happens everyday one the well known analyst haryana chaudhary said that don have corruption haryana brazen loot course will make issue think aap extremely positive development for india they certainly have shifted the center gravity indian politics the cleaner side ,Positive
aap going eat away the congress and the regional parties vote much more than the bjp vote per the last known internal calculations aap expected get around seats while the bjp would still around 200 the biggest perceived advantage aap that they would contain the gandhis and the top congress leadership the seats being fought gandhis any loss there even significant decrease victory margin would huge egg the face situation ,Positive
aap has divided youth voters they are not dividing caste religion most the immature fanatics are young people who haven seen 1990 ,Positive

lets steps want congress free india corruption free india ans corruption free does bjp has image being corruption free and would make india corruption free ans there party that gives that hope ans yes there are aap loksatta which are mostly going come together how can bjp fight ans definitely not lame arguments the team but beating aap their own game become more accountable the people rti transparent disclose funding sources remove criminals field better candidates and not the likes bokhariya radadiya yeddurappa until bjp ready compromise with its election strategy based our demands see reason whatsoever compromise with demands and vote for bjp this the only way fight aap not incessant wailing splitting hair and definitely not ridiculous fear mongering ,Positive
 there chance for the aap win any kind majority the 2014 lok sabha elections nor will any other political configuration have entered the world post election coalition parties you are making the assumption that congress gone that the third front will bad would not count either those technically would stupid for aap not try test waters let see how the results come out also please understand that not everything about bjp modi please try remember that when you examine what aap does ,Negative
aare you referring that aap should not contest just because would cause political unstablitiy shud india declared state for the dynasty politics bjp and congress would against religion kill dont make take arms not stopping you make stupid comments reddit and raising confusing topic have vote and would happily give aap matter what politics equation means end doesnt justify means,Negative
majority the voters dont even know what aap can tell you andhra pradesh tamil nadu aap the best case may cause swing votes the capitals this like the best case scenario they will not anything outside the metro regions government decided the smaller towns and villages urban folk dont give shit cant affect the outcome ,Positive

how political suicide they win and end with hung assembly the regional parties have been doing the exact same thing for the past years unlike them aap would end forming government being part third front ,Positive
arvind kejriwal thousand times better than congress opposition will make sure that bjp does not become another congress aap only helping achieve the target congress mukt bharat should welcome aap entry the scene although not supportive unfair amount media attention being given them ,Positive
false dichotomy either you are for for bjp you are out destroy the nation whoever has heard opposition that does their job properly and keeps the ruling party line ,Negative
eli5 why does everyone else has nothing speak against namo except the riots mean has only one catch not juding him innocent guilty ,Negative
man even though support aap would like bjp come power with absolute majority just because lot people strongly feel that they are the need the hour and bjp not make people lives better both economically and socially hope their supporters would criticize them enough make them change seek alternatives other than congress and bjp they perform well and good for everyone ,Positive
great post hope bjp supporters will explain their points and arguments against the aap succinctly systematically and without vitriol and aap supporters will forego their usual self righteousness and listen ,Positive
first all kudos you for summarizing some very thoughtful points against aap such articles are rare come this subreddit where most the political discussions end descending karma grabbing mud slinging matches and deserves more upvotes have your questions except for their infinite faith and ability simply presume good what the aap supporters base their support believe that the most the supporters have put their faith the past record activism one man arvind kejriwal which pretty much synonymous the case bjp main man narendra modi both their records are out the open for everyone see and fair kejriwal has been tireless social worker even before the whole anna thing blew guess both bjp and aap supporters need asking this question what happens when the sole leader doesn live the promises you vote for person ideology system how ensure that everyone sticks that ideology system modi fan myself but find very difficult answer that well the long run what can aap give that the congress didn and couldn only time will tell that one but most people are hoping for corruption free government lets see how far they take delhi the power collective good intentions the water and power policies not seem panning out how earth aap different from congress under the sun today same old minority appeasement same old subsidy tricks same old attacks narendra modi seems like aap the mirror image congress only under different guise you got there other than few fresh faces the same old system compromises over accountability hoping proven wrong they are freaking corrupt why the heck are aapians not putting them jail instead taking their help this what want understand give this one aap for they didn back down play the dirty game the situation demanded but there was good chance that bjp might have swept more seats there was election also their conditions stunt was just childish nonsense ,Positive
 short ideologically aap congress corruption bjp supporters needlessly worry about losing votes congress who should scared because their voters will gravitate towards aap what aap offering socialism which does appeal large section indians bjp more free market and has the baggage rss ,Positive
 find the question loaded bjp the standards which you need evaluate parties hint bjp not that awesome variety options better for functioning democracy left centrist party with baggage always welcome your points only bit worrying rest are just array silly exaggeration wrong assumption misrepresentations facts sure aap has its foibles but they are fresh kids with much less bad things than other parties come give them time prove their worth bit early write them off ,Positive
aap moving towards communist idea decentralization and putting things and people where they belong cpi and aap have both agreed this bjp and congress say something and something else point discussing ,Neutral
 long they dont all right wing nuts and don have support from the likes kamdev and assaaram which the bjp has with aap ,Positive
 this the reason d84nwor r3a have started discussion elaborating apprehensions about aap hate aap because aap acting proxy for congress their jihad against narendra modi ,Negative
 bjp has iconic and celebrated stalwarts like subramanian swamy clearly scholar learned person gentleman whose opinions should mull over analyze and imbibe with immediate effect ,Positive
long story short most indian voters are not really knowledgeable enough think too deeply about such things they support the aap mainly because the promise new messianic figure kinda like modi without any the baggage existing political parties ,Positive
bjp offering modi aap can offer anything worse than that tried ,Negative
all those questioning aap taking support congress different people have different views his you asking why did take support congress others say should take congress support form government and show what can deliver the country now please you tell who should listen who would you have listened had you been his shoes the choice not simple but has listened his heart that what any sensible person his position would have done yes might succeed his commitments might fail but then the people are watching him closely should not atleast give him chance prove himself only been few days now and has stirred the political class with his stern decisions did bses ever dreamed that they will audited just within days becoming delhi can you already see the fears political class and corrupt the decisions and steps aap taking noone one amongst just like the friend you have who you roam around with everyday not vip just common man but his actions are not common all ,Negative
 skulduggery aap made lofty impragmatic and somewhat unattainable promises but didn’ get into cumbersome details they kept deliberately vague how these promises would kept please read the manifestos the promises are nowhere tall the ones made modi for example the aap spuriously promised give 700 litres free water the poor and according media reports they delivered all good then right but they did not deliver they only gave metered houses not the poorest people the slums who actually are the need that water this actually gives incentive the people delhi get metered installed besides although subsidized should not free there will lack motivation save seems unrestricted even only certain level average consumption middle class family more less 700l the limit acts encouraging factor conserve since can relieve them the bill opposition nuclear energy honestly totally disagree with this move however still need wait for official statement the issue because the reason why aap protested against the kundankulam was due their perception lack safety measures their flawed economic model the biggest problem they are yet release clear well defined description their economic policies and models but this should give sense what their stand ,Positive
man you should write article for paper honestly ,Positive
 aap grows large enough will split into various factions like the janata party did each these factions will handle the different criticisms one will hindu aam aadmi party another will pro nuclear aam aadmi party yet another will free market aam aadmi party ,Positive
the bjp you claim more free market but don think opposition fdi retail they might have their reasons those reasons might justified but still not free market economics questioned modi tendency towards free market economics when his government banned gutkha not spitting and public littering but gutkha while leaving the ban alcohol intact not elegant enforcement penalties domestic violence public misbehavior but easy brute force ban alcohol the ban gutkha caused drop areca nut prices don know about gujarat specifically but speaking couple farmers karnataka where the congress govt banned gutkha understood there was drop about prices much for free market economics this concern regarding anti laissez faire was accentuated bjp leaning towards preserving culture the recent official declaration their homophobia was just example one would want question the sanity the thought processes the upper rungs the bjp the congress too hasn shied away from culture preserving stances example the statements made the mangalore mayor condemning resort culture following the attack group reveling teenagers resort you asked what the aap will differently from the congress the aap was among the first political parties come out against section 377 the ipc that criminalizes anal and oral sex the bjp was among the first support forthrightly and directly criticize homosexuality western disease the congress came out against section 377 but seems more like move salvage some support when elections are around the corner despite having been power since the 2009 statement issued the delhi high court the congress motives here are questionable they also going after the power generation companies delhi irregularities are found expect lot high ranking politicians will incriminated this one more item that the aap will differently from the congress the aap seems delivering election promises however vague words have been followed actions unlike the congress you might consider not delivering water unmetered customers bad thing but this certainly encourages all customers install metered connections further consider such policies socialist something against given voluntarist leanings but this still better than crony capitalism where land offered throw away prices corporates such practices are the beginning the rise monopolies monopolies are irreversible without socialist revolutionary intervention between the aap and the bjp still undecided whom would vote for but the bjp doesn have that great case against the aap you make out while the aap might have displayed socialist tendencies the modi government hasn exactly displayed laissez faire the bjp whole not sure about given their spectacular failure karnataka you might worship subramanian swamy but think nut job you might say nationalism but say self righteousness and the bjp and their conservative culture touting support base has lot would much rather spend government money subsidies than statue not that proponent the former ,Positive

even though not practicing christian christian born and indian citizen this frightens thought modi was different bjp leader pushing national unity and all sad ,Negative
actually bangladeshi hindus should accommodated india for the very reason muslims are part this country much hindus when india was partitioned two nations were formed india and pakistan while india chose remain secular nation giving equal rights all least theory pakistan chose become islamic nation where hindus not have the same right muslims india has accommodate all muslims who wish part this country because founders our nations decided this people may grudge this decision but have accept and fulfill this promise pakistan the other hand doesn have accommodate them and doesn try much fact that hindus bangladesh are suffering because religious persecution also fact that muslims bangladesh are not suffering due religious persecution first rule anyone illegally coming from bangladesh india must deported but humanitarian causes take precedence and based that hindus should accommodated india know that many hindus their hate for modi are willing forsake hindus bangladesh little more understanding the situation required bangladesh was same india then hindus and muslims bangladesh would equal people are overlooking the fact that hindus and muslims are not equal bangladesh hindus and muslims are equal only india and hence this contradiction use pakistan and bangladesh interchangeably for obvious reason not talking politics here anyone disagrees please debate not get your political agenda here ,Positive

 think that hindus both bangladesh and pakistan should given shelter india political asylum considering the international norms providing refugee politically abused and threatened people note that modi had said indian muslims are not indians that would not have been acceptable however giving refugee and integrating religious minorities from neighboring countries seems the right thing religious majorities those countries however need use legal modes immigration they wish rather than just cross over the border squat more resources ,Positive

this the reasoning have mind regarding post godhra riots modi did indeed order the genocide and protect the perpetrators did not order the genocide but actively allowed happen and protected the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop but couldn however after the incidents defended the perpetrators did not want happen tried stop the best his ability but couldn actively pursued many convictions possible after the incidents and are brainers there should doubt anyone mind that such person should not become the also not positive because the fact remains that could not stop people from dying with whatever control had but indeed true would give him the benefit the doubt because his track record wrt development since the riots but the unapologetic tone disrespect towards the media aggressive rss support convince that very unlikely that true hence modi not the right person lead the country especially with many other able leaders found even within the bjp edit grammar,Positive

here good graphic which have way verifying not sure already been posted not haven seen before shows overlay australia radar coverage and the last ping derived arc location the plane the arc goes straight through the satellite system which think already knew before someone highly motivated and with inordinate amounts free time could and stick there the various search areas and debris sightings that would super cool australia refuses confirm deny whether the plane was detected well according the trustworthy media but think either their system was down malfunctioned and they don want anyone know they did detect the airspace and are using that direct the search areas and are keeping secret for who knows why and need the doppler effect only cause cool either way can imagine that they did detect but are refusing use the info release other investigative agencies they spending boatloads money searching for this plane too and doesn make sense for them continue spending what they know incorrect also the plane was detected why would they keep that secret not like their satellite capabilities are secret don think this case the plane flying under the radar think this radar goes pretty low would have wasted enormous amount fuel and the pings probably would have cut off lot sooner think there good chance the plane passed through this region and wasn detected for whatever reason jpg,Positive
question possible the plane was programmed just before 000 fly that way until ran out gas and everybody board was dead ,Positive

the elephant the room that more than likely none the debris that the satellites picked were wreckage from mh370 remember either hearing the news reading article about how ocean currents that part the world often bring together all the stuff ocean has collected over the years bystander and already felt hopeless and frustrated can only imagine how the families and search rescue team feel ,Negative
 the new analysis that the plane flew faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance these factors would lead less flight time but time air the most concrete fact the ping data confirms these points faster burned more fuel and travelled less distance work with the fact the plane must also the air for hours ,Positive
 confused they are saying the plane was traveling faster than they thought more fuel was being used traveled shorter distance but they have pings all the way assuming the plane had not yet crashed until least that moment which would have stopped the pinging there concrete amount time had the air how could travel less distance when was traveling faster for the same amount time are they saying that they overestimated whatever time after the plane was the air which would have had less than hour and that compensates for the decreased distance ,Negative
considering that the current search area takes hours get hours search and hours return for the hours flying time think everyone should thank their lucky stars that the new search area turned out 684 miles the northeast the current search area toward australia turned out 684 miles the opposite way the planes would have had nearly zero time the target search area before they had turn back fuel ,Positive

expert organisations analyse available data and determine the best area search the key pieces information being analysed relate early positional information from the aircraft and
later polling satellite aircraft system the new information based continuing analysis radar data between the south china sea and the
strait malacca before radar contact was lost indicated the plane was travelling faster than previously estimated resulting increased fuel usage
and reducing the possible distance travelled south into the indian ocean the international investigative team supporting the search continues their analysis which could still
result further refinement the potential flight path this has been combined with information about the likely performance the aircraft—such speed
and fuel consumption for example— arrive the best assessment the area which the aircraft likely have entered the water the information provided the international investigative team the most credible lead currently
have the search aircraft wreckage however this information needs continually adjusted for the length time elapsed since the
aircraft went missing and the likely drift any wreckage floating the ocean surface finally let stress that under international convention malaysia has investigative responsibility for
malaysia airlines flight mh370 this stage the atsb’ main task assist the search for the
aircraft this day the search for the aircraft… have drifted the area for days movement taking into account the actual weather and known currents atsb spokesman unsure what the actual speed was the assumption that the aircraft was travelling somewhat constant speed data from satellite polling and radar matches satellite imagery may may not objects and may not debris fields previous search areas have now been abandoned could debris wind scattered around the world depending who picks – under international convention remains the responsibility the country where the aircraft was registered any wreckage which picked will held for the malaysian investigative teams atsb operating behalf the malaysians any debris picked must handed over australian authorities new area will help get more aircraft scene for longer the other benefit the search area longer the roaring 40s – which means better weather conditions more often debris has been seen the old search areas does not want classify satellite and visual spots those areas debris that just not justifiable with what have seen adds that this kind thing not unusual this the normal business search and rescue operations the new area based refined data possible that further analysis may change that again what are you actually refining the relationship between 777 performance satellite pings and various projections versus that information trying find the right coincidence those and the end point when the aircraft runs out fuel all engines die together there are range scenarios you still believe the course changed several times the best assessment the aircraft headed south consistently into the indian ocean are you looking other leads from the malaysian investigation the two primary methods are the analyses the movement the aircraft that the best information can have satellite imagery being followed but has produced sightings sophisticated oceanographic modelling determine drifts recall please that this days after the event was expected happen over that days there’ significant amount random dispersion objects the search area gets significantly bigger over time data marker buoys are being distributed into new search area continue model drift and keep search area confined all data currently available has been made available the search ",Positive
here another hammer their quickness abandon the search area based this new data analysis plane speed means they have literally zero confidence any satellite images they have released over the last week does this means satellite imagery just not good enough useful this search all find this hard believe but with this current abandonment all can conclude that there ton floating garbage debris the indian ocean and satellites not able distinguish these pieces well enough this may truly impossible cause folks ,Negative

2013 2013 despite what you might think voter turn out and interest politics amongst the young the middle class and the hitherto not interested educated masses not aap doing sure the iac movement anna hazare movement did raise lot eyeballs did the protests for nirbhaya but aap did jacksquat outside delhi heck fail get why you folks don understand core issue aap will non existent outside the ncr and maybe punjab they are non entity the south and west even the cities and the hinterland where some our population resides they are absolutely unknown but lets face aap much better opposition than inc for bjp absolutey not let paraphrase person you must dislike lot modi arnab interview said stuff said the heat the election campaign momentary run nation need the assistance every single party every single politics involves the art give and take negotiation and even the shitty congress stood firmly behind the nda when came pokhran 814 the flight kandahar the nda backed the congress some bills aap will not that they are immature and think any give and take the sign corruption and collusion aap will make for shitty opposition shittier ruling party and maybe fit only dharnas and make wild allegations none which will ever taken forward proven like the discoms ambani swiss bank accounts the hundred other baseless allegations they have made winning matters but less joy able against weak opponents most knew time has came for congress either change die forever aap has risen become worthy opponent don believe these poll results for aap just ridiculous that even after delhi mistake they under estimate aap wrong electoral politics only winning counts and what this ridicuolous logic you guys have convinced yourself about the congress not dying did not die did not die 2004 will still the second largest party will still rule odd major states this country will still command minimum vote share nationally can summon allies deadlock parliament needs has money has power has connections has pull the media you think congress dying you are absolutely wrong wait for aap shatter over the next years that bound happen but congress will remain wouldn even surprised pappu mrs vadra came power either 2019 2024 the least upa coming back power aap supporters are naive leaders when comes real politik atleast the way leaders potray themselves also delhi 2013 not the rest india heck delhi 2014 not delhi 2013 mark words again this aap will the second largest party with about seats the delhi assembly 2014 for jlp they will end losing everything state centre and goodwill the people thinking about this scenario with eye future see bad times why party getting much ridiculed for cleaning politics what load rubbish what cleaning parties aap did the following subsidy raj hooliganism only smaller reach they are smaller party endless political drama the cost governance what the difference between mamta not doing anything bengal and claiming moist conspiracy and ak49 doing nothing and claiming the bjp ambani hand behind their absolute non performance associating with absolute communal muslims like taufeeq raza guy who ordered taslima beheaded jamiat islami hind the name being secular aap saar the exact replica the congress bsp tmc they have huge corruption scams their name yet did tmc have the taint scams till took power give time the average aap neta will also very similar the average political goon why you people have forgotten inc they are responsible that are where were yrs back like that india will not like where maya and mulayam romance people alternately lmao truly lmao aap forgot inc real life where ak49 has not mentioned the name rajmata her brood even once publicly except when last minute added her name his list corrupt even these forums which amount nothing irl have seen this behaviour aap aap leaders and followers who skewed the debate away from inc and failures into making some mission stop one man who the least corrupt big margin amongst leaders india today anything aap had virulently campaigned amongst support base small group educated urban indians against the inc the approx vote share would have also come the bjp and might have resulted lesser seats the inc and maybe maybe truly weakend that party but nope you guys had skew the debate away from your handlers ak49 janpath agree wholeheartedly with you the rest your post about keeping clean clarify this post not addressed you individually but the larger superset aap followers here mean offense you and post has hurt you any way please accept apologies lastly still

spelling mistakes etc long post didn truly clean all that said surprised you left out bjp and modi efforts rallying the masses that man accomplished some herculean stuff according the latest india today report has directly participated some 500 speeches been part holograms chai charcha etc some 000 has travelled some 000 and apparently met reached out the total bloody electorate you might dislike him you might hate him but you might want respect him his professionalism single minded focus and absolute bloodymindedness the face opposition from almost all other parties across india and

another less emphasized part this article modi also used his speech speak out against the practice indian family’ selectively aborting females the woman abandoning female babies once they’ born earlier this week the indian government announced that the sex ration among children — standing 927 girl children per 000 boys — the lowest ’ been since india’ independence 1947 ,Negative
 not everyone was pleased with modi’ speech however members the indian national congress were less than impressed with the scope modi offered overall his speech “given that was the first address the new prime minister one would have expected certain vision articulated him the trajectory the next five years ” party spokesperson and former minister manish tewari said “but unfortunate that got bogged down pedestrian issues without being able rise the occasion ” pedestrian issues what does tewari consider not pedestrian issue this pedestrian ,Positive
yeah one was talking about rape until heard this brave speech ,Positive
maybe part the problem the very high rates female infanticide india the selective abortion female fetuses that been going for the last years maybe the men are rapey because there actual shortage women and maybe the whole dialogue needs include the entire spectrum indian attitudes towards women from dowries class systems sex and better law enforcement for crimes against women ,Positive

 there should not question conflict between allopathy ayurveda and homeopathy all the three systems treatment have some best things them said chief minister said that homeopathic medicines prove very effective the case teething children seen that the irritating teething process makes children extremely weak and malnourished would great service the homeopathy can used for keeping strong the immune system child during teething process and thus preventing children from malnutrition regarding this appealed homeopathy association launch drive for curbing malnutrition some context would good its not like anti modern science unlike our kulcha who anti alternate medicine alternate medicine working for some who are force them stop using whatever happened freedom choice only applicable when suits our ideological propaganda ,Positive

now directly competing with odac instead undercutting them you know schiit operating with business strategy that defies common business paradigms first most businesses first sell expensive product and use help build cheaper product that they market larger consumer base the logic that the halo effect the exclusive product will help drive sales the cheaper mass market for example light harmonic leveraged the aura their davinci dac for geek contrast schiit started with cheap schiit and worked its way the niche expensive stuff second while original designs tend complicated especially electronics they tend get simpler products iteratively evolve through generations again schiit the opposite although fair certain aspects the schiit business model does make lot sense offer base model and then rather than reinventing ghr wheel add features subsequent generations improve profit because you can charge premium for the added features for example auto companies this all the time staggering convertible models year two after they launch the sedan coupe and they are very savvy about marketing which again isn surprising given jason background ,Positive

 currently running first gen magni modi but might consider upgrade pair uber some amount time have powered speakers desk the preamp out magni uber would very helpful right now just moving cables back and forth and the multiple input the modi would allow solve the same issue with and ps3 usb from and optical from ps3 can imagine there perceptible difference audio quality but the extra ports would very useful guess just have decide convenience really worth should just wait until get some much nicer headphones and then upgrade higher end amp ,Positive

yes your key point very sensible however you too are prejudiced and biased looking your own commentary counter questions about similar practices other religions you make valid point that false equivalency countering similar practices other religion way deflect the question recent examples include the charles hebdo incident where every single person india and very rightly condemned the attack however when rss and bjp members harass author into pulping his books there appears condemnation for the hindu right aren you doing the same thing which you accuse others doing you are using false equivalency and countering rss bjp narrative with charlie hebdo example you want the discussion limited critique hinduism without the use deflections giving examples other regions the same logic limit charlie hebdo massacre discussion what attack radicalized muslims not compare with bjp rss activities they are not the same category all ,Positive
some people believe that you criticize your own religion the absolute worst thing have often spoken here well real life when people wrong things the name religion and have been branded traitor agnostic atheist and paper jain egs speak against loudspeakers being used during ganesh chaturti get the you speak now when hindu festival but why not during eid arguments times basically cannot criticise own religion and want have criticise all religions otherwise anti hindu often times have been critical about jainism and its recent mutation into intolerant religion from peaceful tolerant one and have been branded traitor this irl the way many relatives and acquaintances they are quick point out that why not speak about other religions too often wondered about this and its always puzzled why have such mentality think the root cause lies the fact that not like being told what the problems are are too proud and not want others point out whats wrong home deep down know and make ourselves feel better sit and point out the problems with other religions and most the times the elders and the spiritual gurus and sadhus often use fear tactics quell such critics from their own home from speaking out they use social punishments like banishing one from the community and labeling people traitors this cents from own experiences such labels have not stopped and never will the argument that cannot criticise own religion bogus don need criticise others just criticise own ,Positive
this also reminds this twice gilded comment that probably the top comment any post here said however views india any india studies class the from bottom approach starting from problems indian society treatment women dalits religious minorities ascribes these problems hinduism and hindu theology caste system hindu patriarchy upper caste chauvinism which considered the fundamental block indian nationalism hindutva wars against pakistan and the indian state constitution government etc vast majority this sub completely agreed with this appraisal however nobody noticed the hypocrisy are viewing islam and islamic countries the same way ,Positive
 agree with noticed myself and whenever comment something religious have remind myself that mention something that wrong with hinduism have somehow bring the evils islam christianity otherwise get snark about secularism ,Negative
well hinduism has been historically open change many rituals and customs 18th and 19th century have been outlawed are now obsolete still evolving abrahmic religions the other hand still justify pedophilia polygamy stoning kuffar killing and other monstrosities suggest keeping track posts and comments that bring commonplace regressive hindu light india sure you will surprised ,Positive
hypocrisy thy name india ,Neutral
 there was call for reform hinduism then the caste system wouldn dying sati would still exist etc hinduism continuously reforming you are just too blind see ,Negative
" think when comes general religiosity and adherence holy books hindus are fairly low down the order nobody here gonna defend dogmatists within the hindu religion the examples you cite are not really clear cut the ritual probably not encouraged today context but back then was simply not rape had child marriages the only form marriage the past but have moved from that and now consider social evil wrong right not absolute and has seen context also regarding the tamil novel you simply don know what you are talking about the problem more related casteism and libel than free speech now not suggesting free speech not factor this case but means the only factor lastly lot people criticize today islam because the literalist manner practiced lot people very regressive and outmoded belief system reformers within the community should ideally step forward but they are silenced via the religion itself non muslims affected will only naturally end criticizing then least they aren inhibited notice how similar criticisms are not made for any other religion also this means just indian phenomenonh
",Positive
 malayalee guessing the nayars mentioned the article which doesn seem have any sources are whom know nairs don know any nairs who have such ritual their culture spoken two nair friends about both whom thought was making shit and here you are painting all hinduism with one broad brush probably dipped the same virgin blood the article talks but why does one talk about this hindu can take criticism etc etc probably because the article full shit lol this fucking thread people having shitfit over vague article that doesn seem clarify anything ,Negative
 yet one seems reflect this practice but the post littered with crass humour this what most people here resort when they see something insult their favourite dharma their bharatmata their favourite politician you can read leela sampson being referred bitch here just because she dared pass and most people here hated the fact then foreign correspondent once wrote article slightly critical modi and yet again the right wing here bombarded her with abuses when rape gets reported from india the energy this sub channeled into how the fault worldnews for picking rape news stories from india you should understand the demographic the right wing the people who call others anti hindu and sickular their ego carries sense superiority accrued twice once when they are told how their religion the best and the second time about their caste being the most noble when they are exposed fact which strikes theose delusions their instinct label the other person jholachaap question his intentions anti hindu anti india perfect example who also the personal hero many here subramanium swamy ,Positive
 charlie not charles ,Neutral
 the yardstick modern wingnuts and their counterparts from half century ago ambedkar was anti hindu too you should proud find yourself such esteemed company instead worrying about how wingnuts will perceive you ,Positive
 hope this doesn make pro hindu because don have lot with religion begin with having said that heres something for you ponder about you compared the killing humans bullying one person which definitely wrong well okay worries from north and dont know lot about speaking forced penetrations not sure how forced that its ritual for them which practiced specific community south would ignorant would like bina jane gyaan baantna but how are these forced penetrations different from forced circumcision why does forced circumcision spread across the world abrahamic religions not bother you are you sexist sir everything that fucks decent human life wrong doesn matter what religion that practice belongs the fact that you were able make the observation that you posted shows that you have bias well and suggestion for you would work that ,Negative
tbh don think its problem with hinduism and hindus indian issue are incapable debating rationally and see criticism personal attack you say something bout hindus met with something worse about islam and why that not being criticized you say something about india people will say something bad about iran some other place and say india better than that say something bad about tendulkar and the response you get but but what about dravid who blah blah made that but see very deep seated resentment india when comes criticising their own yes and applies everything not just religion and applies indians general not just india,Negative
 think the ills hinduism well documented the intelligentsia there isn one person here who not willing accept that some the practices are regressive the problem that the criticism the religion has become pervasive that the ones doing have become blind the ills other communities there way radicalization the minority community compared forced penetration but our intelligentsia for long time has thought and still thinks that casteism the mother all evils and need inherently ashamed our religion classic case throwing the baby along with the bathwater what they have failed consistently apply the logic other communities corollary that frustrated people see the posts critical hinduism and think well what new here knew this and made feel ashamed hey look the muslims circumcise but they maintain the secular fabric the nation has gone the extent that need create saffron terror more recently censor board reaction and msg most people take the internet highlight the inconsistency dealing with criticism religion ,Negative
frankly don even get your logic the practice described that link yours sure nobody modern times have seen first ask you get people who seen firsthand and then let criticise all you want short was moronic post that caught attention only jokes ,Positive
hindus have belief that hinduism very very different from other religions and that lacks most evils other religions this could the result being juxtaposed with extreme sides islam under the mughals and after that for long long time regardless believe this has led hindus feel that hinduism infallible conversations with parents have all ended with them either being hindu apologists just flat denying the wrong that exists last conversation here with individual where tried argue that india isn backward because islamic presence resulted being called muslim with the person deciding that the only way could prove non religious nature atheist was each posted pornographic images muhammad and his daughter and hindu deities not that care too much about the religious pornography but was too stunned the lack maturity general civility that suggestion ,Negative
atheist here and hindu don like call myself culturally hindu because frankly don like much and that was the first thing that came mind yes digressed from posting about that that post didn want create shitstorm ,Positive
hindus here and elsewhere seem have totally forgotten that the caste system still exists and that inherently unjust and barbaric heck even urban educated upper caste hindus wont marry loe caste dalit imagine the situation some tiny ass bihar village all religious people know have holier than thou attitude where they never ever acknowledge their own faults but chide others for theirs whichever way you look hinduism has major caste problem ehich refuses away and you are doubt tell your dad that you are marrying dalit girl then report his response here better still try being lower caste and enter temple some small bihar village ,Positive
 the proverbial straw that broke the camel back would this post sack bricks and has found the usual hindu haters whine along from the post that triggered this outpouring frequently symbolic defloration satisfied the requirements the reform pretentiously seeks has already happened ,Positive
 jain and honestly dont give shit dont get wrong think healthy discussion relgious topics essential call out obviiously stupid rituals antics people out cheat gullible people just that dont find myself being interested such discssions maybe its coz view more fatalistic religion just another way people group themselves every civilization and yeah thats including western nations groups itself amonst commonly held beliefs have strong opinions about those who dont believe their set values its trait any civilization and will present some form the other kill this there will something that will take its place there escaping you will always grouped into something whether you like not and you will possess some beliefs and characteristics that will offensive disagreeable wrongful the other person whether those beliefs are right wrong subjective and therefore can never been categorized into right wrong ,Negative
you know hate when topic regarding hinduism islam and christianity make guest appearances this sub has many users who are either pseculars right wingers balanced discussion hard come yes islam needs reforms but does hinduism comparatively hinduism might more progressive than islam but doesn mean should lenient when barbaric activities like the defloration ceremony takes place hinduism not perfect one may hide behind but what about muslims when any criticism hinduism comes but doesn really change anything hope people stop comparing religions when specific discussion carried out about particular religion and talk about what wrong and what could done about the problems agnostic couldn care less about any religion but please islam needs reforms reminds this mods why did you delete the post regarding islamic reforms saying doesn concern india and does hinduism not comparing them the quantum reforms needed are different but yes discussions even hinduism should balanced edit added word ,Negative
 upvoted did not expect that much ,Positive
 the proverbial straw that broke the camel back would this post regarding the above post wrote called funny response here what wrote pliss make lingam next life did not know that the practice inhumane sir knew but grown numb now every other day hear things that wished wouldn have heard think too much about feel like will drive insane how maintain sanity writing comments like above know every way that wrong harsh and unfair that above response wrote you look the other way expresses loss hope depression thoughts someone who has given all hopes and course and directly implied sexual joke feel helpless reading things like this can anything feel like worthless human being without any purpose meaning life feel frustrated myself feel like man who has screamed his lungs out because injustice and unfairness but this harsh world has numbed him emotionless all can now laugh make fun and sit back and nothing that who ,Negative
 however when rss and bjp members harass author into pulping his books there appears condemnation for the hindu right but many comments appear that justify harassment freedom expression equally outrageous the comments from the opposite ends the spectrum that justifies freedom libel slander freedom expression somebody had threatened murugan there absolutely defence for they need booked under relevant sections the law that however doesnt mean murugan had the right assosciate real world community fictious slanderous ritual and not expect those slandered pursue legal means redress the situation also dont know where you got the pulping the book the latest seems has agreed remove the portions the book associating the women with the fictious ritual and ahead and bjp rss werent the main protestors even the original protests were the kongu vellala koundars whose community women were portrayed negative way was only later that the hindu munnani joined them and perhaps you are not aware the actual flow events fyi regarding the floration few redditors from the nair community the community that was mentioned practising this have mentioned they havent even heard this valid question what separates libel from freedom speech are supposed defend libel under the defence constitutes freedom speech would like you clarify that ,Positive
completely agree regarding the ritual defloration understand that applies specifically tamils and again specifically the tamils traditional enough have coming age ceremony some don and again those who actually allow the priest conduct this ritual who assuming the minority many hibdus treat something that other and not part hinduism per but yes there are tons problems with hinduism and this sub reddit answers any criticism with look what the muslims are doing sickular which isn right must learn accept what dole out and don think comparing ourselves the muslims going make any better ,Positive
great post would add economic theory angle nda upa there was very public spat between jagdish bhagwati and amartya sen recently whether gujarat development model good one bad the red side amartya sen who has been proponent improving social indicators education illiteracy bottom approach sorts reckons that once people become more skilled they will start contributing the economy and accelerate growth the blue side jagdish bhagwati who has been proponent policies aimed accelerating growth reckons that acceleration growth will increase government revenues which can then used improve the quality life the peoples you look where nda and upa take their inspiration when comes economic policies then becomes obvious that nda more towards jagdish bhagwati and upa more towards amartya sen basically comes down choose your poison choose nda not because economic genius who thinks one better than the other its just that have tried one and has failed for nearly years lets give the other side chance ,Positive
 formatted all the tables thanks vim anyway copy your post and will delete the comment every second day there thread why educated people support that fount communal poison the bjp instead all endlessly circle jerking over subjective stuff wanted take slightly different approach and put forth some key macro economic indicators that compare data from nda era and the upa regimes even plotted graphs excel but imgur won allow upload excel graphs and have idea how upload these onto reddit otherwise ideas welcome also how does one make tables reddit copy pasting from excel again does not work the data indicator nda upa upa agriculture industry services gdp growth rates nothing much choose from though the upa seems have done well across all sectors how this achieved will cover little later indicator nda upa upa cad cad the upa performance looks horrible one could attribute increasing oil prices touched peak 100 barrel certain extent but only portion why the cad went down horribly indicator nda upa upa inflation wpi inflation cpi inflation seems have been horribly mismanaged the upa and this largely due deficit financing and pumping huge funds into the rural sector the form mnrega the mnrega was the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients drove prices over and hurt the economy whole indicator nda upa upa fiscal deficit again how did the upa achieve the funding such profligate schemes such mnrega the food safety act the loan waiver deficit financing essentially spent more which govts usually more than what earned this also has the side effect fueling inflation and now come why believe even these numbers are illusionary absolute increase employment nda upa agriculture manufacturing non manufacturing services total the net jobs added the nda years compared the upa data for 2013 was not available not even comparable and this why believe the upa growth was illusory jobless growth factor the million unemployed people hitting our workforce every year and imperative that nation find jobs for all them another factor would have liked compare but data not available prior 2008 will leave out scope but just mention this the indicator gross fixed capital formation infrastructure the nda well know focussed lot infrastructure roads and the highway network being chief amongst these the nda added more roads years than years other governments combined without the govt massively investing actual infrastructure job creation and economic growth going difficult manage this not new either the upa mismanagement indira gandhi did pretty much the same thing she created import fueled bubble illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation windows opportunity memoirs economic adviser krishnaswamy goes into detail into how indira almost wrecked the national economy recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring the late indira also established the trend socialistic economy not her father who piloted mixed economy ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal banking wheat and imposing draconian restrictions the private sector indira also failed focus infrastructure and during her first regime cut down investment infrastructure after nehru who did very well guide the indian economy given his set challenges every succeeding gandhi dynast has been absolute disaster for the national economy the problem the gandhi congress way has now caught and almost every major party follows the same dead approach populsim throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics subjective opinion bjp see party that serious about building infrastructure that serious about creating jobs that while populist marries this populism with sense pragmatism arguably the only party right now that sees merit manufacturing being the workhorse the indian economy see how the bjp method has worked relative india course places like chatisgarh gujarat goa yes has failed karnataka yet has the resilience learn and apply lessons and not just throw some dynast scion continue the same tired old politics sloganeering empty tokenism and sops all won work without some hard reforms and this something the bjp has established track record and this why support the bjp source for the data the planning commission php data datatab edit seriously cross heart and hope die pinky swear level don care about points and self post doesn even give any points but seconds after posted this was wonder being brigaded the namo army edit somebody please tell how draw tables upload graphs here the post looks messy without tables ,Negative
excellent effort thanks for the post was big fan the nda govt because was when was india and aware interested politics and their policies seemed make sense not sure some things can ever quantified your analysis 2008 recession for mostly because economics are not forte also did the sanctions that came after the nuclear tests have any effect ,Positive
 add some context most economies except are struggling the moment there massive that holding the similar efforts are also being made europe japan and china but have far had little success most currencies have lost massively against the but inr has held brazil was considered india peer and its economy the dumps and russia are struggling well though russia can blame some its tussle with nato ukraine the midst all this india stands tall you look the sensex its been going pretty steadily ever since became clear that modi was going come power oil crash has certainly helped the economy but the rise started much before that the criticism from some sections the society will continue matter how modi performs but doesn matter the big picture since the majority firmly behind modi the guy has the drive confidence and ability take our country forward fiis will continue pour money based fundamentals modi agenda was development and can already see solid results less than year ,Positive

 doubt upa did not manage the finances properly but the inflation during upa1 was also partly due the prevailing market conditions where rbi had for omo purchases which effect led inflation rbi reportedly bought bonds close 6lac crores during the period 2008 2013 but the indiscretion showed upa further worsened ,Negative

inconclusive view time the best judge can really compare the post era this simplistically there was massive growth and movement the mid late because the level from which things started was low congress being historically center left party has always had socialist tendencies chose use the funds give freebies the section which was less developed vote banks etc the expense pumping that money into sectors such are infra health etc india not rich the mid india entire gdp was less than defense budget can spend use its money everything has prioritize congress choose what did only time will tell how right wrong they were when compared what comes after them current govt will also have prioritize because india while longer equal defense budget numbers still pretty poor terms its revenue can just pump money into everything and make things everywhere right that just not going happen ,Positive

with the obligatory grain salt not sure why people are looking that new pulse rifle and chanting yay pulse rifles are getting fixed looks like the impact rating that gun par with the pre tdb super pox vlo sold the vanguard even with the high impact that gun making the best pulse rifle the game that time imo was still annoyingly under powered ,Positive
 guess tdb build contained placeholder dates for how the data hoping they are place holder difficult enough hold fireteam interest raiding right now with the expectation week wait month wait will kill this game bungie really need get response out for this one ,Negative
not really liking the warlock helmets well usually have exotic that slot anyway the rest the armor looks good hopefully both sides the coat are intact what got for tdb pretty bad all for tatters but don rip off entire side the titan stuff alright again not liking the helmets the real question here why hunters get all the cool armor seriously the helmet gauntlets vest everything all looks amazing blood splatters may have finally make hunter when this releases ,Positive
this can legit the vendor gear for warlocks doesn look like hobo rags ,Neutral

 issue with this that have wait months for what basically raid some story missions and some crucible maps will never play opinion know some people enjoy crucible and months mean since the precious expansion which was only raid some story missions and some crucible maps for any citizens payed £ for both these the dark below was fairly lackluster expansion far expansions and lot was just textured stuff which seemed lazy know this seems like dissapointed with the game because content lol kind rant but more with what paying comparison what getting bought the season expansion pass very early because was naive about the game course still going check out the content but for that money could bought whole game what the new expansion seems key word seems running the information have heard offering the same the previous new weps armor missions and raid which for £ the price without expansion pass just doesn seem worth that much feel like paying for bigger grind genuinely hope this isn the case enjoy the game extent but only extent can burn out this game quickly now avoid playing too much now hope how invigorates love for the game edit1 shoutout for this post btw good finds ,Positive
 the only one getting tired all the warlock cloaks being tattered messes ,Negative

hunter confirmed master race with the blood all you other peasants its armor,Positive
 not fussed about weapons and armor there will always good weapons use and collect whatever armor takes higher light levels what interests about this post are the supposed release date later than expected true and the story from that first snippet sounds like the popular theories how turning against thee queen are likely true light levels believe someone recently quoted luke smith saying that they wouldn repeat tdb mistakes how reasonably confident that vendor gear won exceed armor having said that wouldn shocked new vendor gear matches armor which also arguably bad because makes the first two raids skippable ,Positive
can someone please talk with via japanese and translate every bit info accurately possible ,Neutral
 the light levels here are correct new vendor max then you can reach 156 light level with just vendor gear soooo once again they are rendering all raid gear obsolete instantly sweet use grinding characters ,Positive

the way see seems that accessing this data that has already been pre loaded meaning altering his console system calendar trick destiny thinking may 19th this explained his sentence turned out was may that house wolves was unlocked the game result analyzing this implies that had through each date until may 19th enabled the first date for access ,Negative

 sounds like this was some sort datamining and then glitching create screenshots moreover the hot fix destiny using the system the console will delivered about four weeks from now does this mean you are analyzing leaked and beta patches that are not scheduled drop for another weeks nice you share whatever this with the community but think your tentative conclusion overreach which you put with question mark know you not claiming certainty the developers may have may the drop dead date for dlc release and uncertain will ready march intermediate step they moved the pre loaded assets that were already partially added later date avoid issues like that accidental relaunch the not yet retooled iron banner the stuff you show not necessarily final yet either stats and wording could easily changed they continue play test the dlc content house ,Positive

good job coal auction now what the timeline where all those behind the upa scams are jailed and the money looted returned ,Positive
the problem with these insane auction revenue that the money eventually comes out our pockets basically the government taking huge loan with emis and forcing the people pay back both principal and interest some private company that they have control over the low cost the licenses helped boost mobile penetration across the country from million 2004 375 million 2008 670 million 2012 the lowered cost calls from increased competition allowed poorer sections get connected despite the rupee plunging from inr 2008 inr 2012 ever since the licenses were cancelled the cost voice calls has gone multiple times spectrum was auctioned the highest bidder years ago and were supposed have 150 million subscribers 2014 but all managed was measly million and coverage concentrated the cities and most rural areas don even have the option using even they are willing pay for but all the money from the bwa auctions ended being spent schemes like fsb aaadhar subsidising loss making psus like air india bsnl etc windfall auctions are never good for the consumers large because thanks the huge amounts invested upfront which are usually bank loans taken the companies they try recover much money possible the earliest and that means higher prices for everyone until they start making profits the same thing happened with auctions europe where telcos bid massive amounts the auctions and then failed roll out networks and went begging the govt change the license terms and allow the operators share networks etc meet coverage goals these coal auctions are worse because the central govt allocates the coal blocks and all the money goes the states which may may not have actual use for the money instead coming viable development schemes that get funding from japan etc now the states will able spend all this money any hare brained scheme that the party power can choose promote and unlike spectrum where both the businesses and the end consumers are located the same area coal consumers are not necessarily located the state that producing them people other parts the country end pumping money coffers the coal producing states governments and will not even see the benefits the 15lakh crores that going collected from them edit here opinion piece pointing out other flaws the system the auctions 115021601818 html edit2 not defending upa practice handing out spectrum coal mines their friends just pointing out the flaws going with the highest bidder shows shortsightedness the part the government short term good for the govts the day may lead long term pains and losses for the country large more other reply ,Positive

even though iit and iim students are not that much different intellectual ability than most indian student they gain lot having access resources most not have plus corporate leaders tend give more weight the brand value than actual results most iit students are now working managerial level counter this the economy need opened allow more companies set this will give ripple effect getting more core jobs graduates indian education system has crossed the line where serious revamp the entire system needed for the last years the sector has given limited impetus the growth story relying foreign nationalities help set corporate india true there are people who have challenged the system and made the nation proud but considering the potential the great nation the numbers who swim against the tide remains abysmally low its high time that the entire sector changed course can create and nurture potentials where stand now unfortunately the present higher education sector india like roulette wheel hard escape from its clutches but you are one the lucky ones you hit the jackpot favors less talent but creates populace that again studies and henceforth become teachers again the system the system solely existing make reason for the system exist the first place pure science streams have eroded itself that level where the sole existence subjects like zoology and applied chemistry and physics now create teachers rather than aspiring scientists the situation worse engineering streams where almost the graduates are unemployable any industry fortunately streams like english communication and and literature they have wide variety jobs that they are qualified for but its the sad truth that rarely their field learning policy documents and vision initiatives should used hardcore road map that can used predict and shape the future sector its highly important that eduction sector has clear view its role developing nation because ultimately each and every measurement growth country irrevocably depended the educated resource the same nation policy guidelines syllabus the strength any university its alumni the success the alumni the professional world directly linked the value that the university can impart its undergraduate and graduate training programs the syllabus these programs must written the alumni the benefit that the university gets real time feedback current industry needs and what might require the future this gives chance for the university provide skill development which valued and appreciated the industry obsolete technology still being taught colleges across india likelihood its use apocalypse this thought process must uprooted once the basic skills have been thought industry standard technology must imparted and studied detail otherwise industry will have take pain retraining new employees which puts the company backward trajectory economic sense present syllabus being created and modified people who used work the industry this needs stopped the alumni the most powerful organization that the university can trust blindingly alumni must involved each and every process the working the university helps the long run keep gold standard thesis works numerous shady companies have cropped which does for fee final year projects and thesis works students flock these organizations they can receive the final product with money rather than true effort this has curbed original thesis work should appreciated and awarded relevant training technologies can mitigate lack confidence students and help inspire original thought processes students must benefit from technological prowess available and competent guides who can guide them rote learning should avoided and learning should imparted seminar style topics must thought drill the concepts initially and then promote self learning through self made experiments and research most universities multi disciplinary research and thesis works are not allowed noted that the boundaries study subjects are blurry line and most topics overlap each other students and graduate research fellows must given the flexibility research multidisciplinary topics rather than stay within well defined dark boundary engagement programs universities must have the potential leverage industrial experts take talks relevant topics least twice trice week that can conveniently held after class hours not disturb regular discussion instruction hours the benefit this method many students benefit from actual industry working knowledge and multiple topics can covered during the same bell curve grading grading must bell curve that shows students and learning associates where they stand relation the rest the class rather than blatant pass fail grade that provide information service provider questions must engaging ones that simulate the critical thinking faculties the ward dissuade students from rote learning methods like open book learning and sheets with formulas and data values must provided the advantage such system that students will forced learn the concepts and move beyond industry real life are workers forced recall mundane equations and data values even its emergency situation critical failure component factory equations not help there experience and wisdom helps that achieved and made logical thinking processes usage technological tools for better learning are lucky live age where all information can easily accessed anywhere the entire wealth human knowledge now available through the power the internet hard paper back textbooks must shunned away and replaced internet resources and line well off line discussion groups periodic test and assessment should done and evaluated using line tools that can exactly pinpoint parts sections that particular student must concentrate this also helps minute tracking the learning process and make sure individual attention can given for certain students certain topics language proficiency this the most important and relevant need students and faculty must highly proficient english language now the facto standard for communication across the world has needed given more preference than regular topics communication standards for students across india abysmal its best english language learning must given golden place among primary learning centers and undergraduate schools our researchers and graduates suffer lot due their lack proficiency which immediately closes lot doors significant effort need overhaul the higher education sector india the usage relevant tools and methodologies must

 here copy the judgment 1427183283 pdf you can add this the post 123 page judgement reading now and will post there anything worth sharing first the final judgement 119\ conclusion may summarise what has been held above section 66a the information technology act 2000 struck down its entirety being violative article and not saved under article section 69a and the information technology procedure safeguards for blocking for access information public rules 2009 are constitutionally valid section valid subject section being read down mean that intermediary upon receiving actual knowledge from court order being notified the appropriate government its agency that unlawful acts relatable article are going committed then fails expeditiously remove disable access such material similarly the information technology intermediary guidelines” rules 2011 are valid subject rule sub rule being read down the same manner indicated the judgment section 118 the kerala police act struck down being violative article and not saved article summary reasons cited section 66a freedom speech and expression under our constitutional scheme stated earlier not open the state curtail freedom speech promote the general public interest reasonable restrictions quoting from another judgement the right freedom speech and expression includes the right disseminate information wide section the population possible the access which enables the right exercised also integral part the said right the wider range circulation information its greater impact cannot restrict the content the right nor can justify its denial public order all these counts clear that the section has proximate relationship public order whatsoever the example guest hotel annoying girls telling – this court has held that mere annoyance need not cause disturbance public order clear and present danger – tendency affect viewed either the standpoint the clear and present danger test the tendency create public disorder section 66a would not pass muster has element any tendency create public disorder which ought essential ingredient the offence which creates defamation section 66a does not concern itself with injury reputation something may grossly offensive and may annoy inconvenient somebody without all affecting his reputation clear therefore that the section not aimed defamatory statements all incitement offence section 66a has nothing with “incitement offence” section 66a severely curtails information that may sent the internet based whether grossly offensive annoying inconvenient etc and being unrelated any the eight subject matters under article must therefore fall foul article and not being saved under article declared unconstitutional decency morality what has been said with regard public order and incitement offence equally applies here section 66a cannot possibly said create offence which falls within the expression ‘decency’ ‘morality’ that what may grossly offensive annoying under the section need not obscene all – fact the word ‘obscene’ conspicuous its absence section 66a vagueness quite obviously prospective offender section 66a and the authorities who are enforce section 66a have absolutely manageable standard which book person for offence under section 66a chilling effect and overbreadth therefore hold that the section unconstitutional also the ground that takes within its sweep protected speech and speech that innocent nature and liable therefore used such way have chilling effect free speech and would therefore have struck down the ground overbreadth possibility act being abused not ground test its validity section 66a otherwise invalid cannot saved assurance from the learned additional solicitor general that will administered reasonable manner governments may come and governments may but section 66a goes forever assurance from the present government even carried out faithfully would not bind any successor government must therefore held that section 66a must judged its own merits without any reference how well may administered severability the present case where has been held above section 66a does not fall within any the subject matters contained article and the possibility its being applied for purposes outside those subject matters clear therefore hold that part section 66a severable and the provision whole must declared unconstitutional article challenge found invalid the petitioners were right this article argument would apply equally all other offences created the information technology act which are not the subject matter challenge these petitions find therefore that the challenge the ground article must fail procedural unreasonablenes having struck down section 66a substantive grounds need not decide the procedural unreasonableness aspect the section section 69a will noticed that section 69a unlike section 66a narrowly drawn provision with several safeguards first and foremost blocking can only resorted where the central government satisfied that necessary secondly such necessity relatable only some the subjects set out article thirdly reasons have recorded writing such blocking order that they may assailed writ petition under article 226 the constitution section being exemption provision closely related provisions which provide for offences including section 69a have seen how under section 69a blocking can take place only reasoned order after complying with several procedural safeguards including hearing the originator and intermediary have also seen how there are only two ways which blocking order can passed – one the designated officer after complying with the 2009 rules and the other the designated officer when has follow order passed competent court the knowledge spoken the said sub rule must only through the medium court order subject this the information technology intermediaries guidelines rules 2011 are valid ,Negative

methods which have worked for thousands upon thousands years and they doing successfully think the best way convince people sustainable practices implement them successfully ourselves and people like darshan singh are living examples what possible when you put your heart and mind into the practice forget about two birds killing multiple birds all with one stone ultimately sustainable agriculture

hey rajarajac great fan your posts you have once again raised some very legitimate points here however feel that you are playing down the impact oil price inflation bit remember economics lessons correctly the argument goes that the price oil directly impacts the cost transportation goods and lesser extent the production electricity thereby having cascading effect the prices pretty much everything transport consume not sure about how big impact there due this relationship but this theory does seem reasonable for further reading asp this not discount the argument you have made food hoarding for that ,Positive

edit lol sanghi bridage downvoting with all their might posting this edit for the few people who expand the comment the frivolous and inaccurate not talking about the upa thing posted all that could spot and not know about the starting though completely wrong food prices are always correlated with oil prices and this happens for many reason transportation fertiliser production etc well know economic fact that not yet seen refuted the arguments the contrary seem you have numbers showing this don but neither does the have numbers stating the opposite that oil price decline did not contribute the fall inflation take the other stuff you will but honest opinion the statistics bullshit oil prices are and always have been huge factor food inflation economics 101 comment the upa hoarding though while may have been big factor oil prices were definitely more than just minor factor according most estimates oil and other fuels accounts for cost food production trying imply that oil prices are only fraction food inflation bullshit fact this food beverages and tobacco rural urban combined fuel and light rural urban combined basic maths dictates that item has weightage the key driver inflation while something with overall relatively insignificant important but not the driver complete crap that weightage contains oil prices built into the statistical term you looking for serial correlation where the supposedly independent term are actually correlated with each other ,Positive

 read this brilliant article pratap bhanu mehta great deal agreement though few things have changed since modi became and large the article holds good even after almost years few points from the article for all the hoopla over reforms the development models all political parties look pretty much the same the particular differences are due the timing and context when they were power both are incremental reformers both reform largely when impelled crisis and the variations their stances are variations circumstance not conviction both believe the rhetoric the poor first both have roughly the same approach institutions they are instruments used those power not instruments protect against them there actually more fierce contestation and blocking decisions precisely because there much underlying agreement when there deep consensus the ground the conflict longer disagreement ,Positive
not bjp supporter the problem have with people justifying this changing for the better that bjp going stick congress policies what the point voting them every criticism bjp govt gets you responses either congress was worse you anti national the opposition currently congress easy pick any point they raise why didn you this yourself bullshit the two parties keep flinging shit each other for the same actions the same issues while common voters get taken for ride honest was happy under congress rule there was much less vitriol the govt communication there were govt cheerleaders the ruling party didn make their supporters feel like victims secularism think said this before and say again rather live with scams than communal hatred ,Positive
bjp different from other political parties india when comes shoutfests and posturing the media when they are opposition and compromising when they come power also believe that any political party should pragmatic their approach and stands have changed according situation turn today would have been the wrong turn years ago another point noted that modi was not the helm bjp when many these statements were made his personal stand might have been different and since power has the ability change these sees fit still there are many disappointing turnarounds that said here take since promised the major hangup according the article before was regarding the guarantee supply and tracking nuclear fuel indo french deal ece has pretty much guaranteed lifetime supply for french reactors what this would mean that other nations would have follow suit will lose out against the french henderson brooks major fuck they should make public but believe there are few major bomb shells there that making the govt hesitant the same hold trues for subhas chandra bose fiasco well aggressive posturing for vote bank but the basic theme has not changed calling sharif for inauguration was good move gave diplomatic leverage pakistan issue something have live with only thing government can increase covert ops strengthen intelligence and speed arms procurement something parrikar has been doing quite right after years fuckups afspa still effect its draconian law and should used the right proportions the after article mentions that bjp will govern such way that afspa will longer needed turn here they never advocated for permanent afspa see the major issue raised bjp during that timeframe opposition was that they did not take the opposition into confidence secondly the illegal immigration from bangladesh has reached its heights bjp wants cut down that and dealing with exclaves the first step that process retarded oppose opposition definite turn that would support uma bharti talked about years you look the years plan talks about short term changes years medium term next years and long term next years there are things happening the ground level example phase clean ganga campaign completed 201 html definite turn and something don like aadhar and uid has been badly managed but the other option let the 1000s crore spent the project pragmatic approach would have been audit check the discrepancies the system modi was against not giving fitting reply ceasefire this time around the response was not something mild 1272821 aspx has bjp said anything about not giving delhi full statehood whats the turn here bjp supported the old bill and wanted changes that 2015 they are proposing new bill with changes that they see fit will reply the rest later you fill them ,Positive

thanks for posting one the most descriptive pieces seen india however have issue with the fact that your headline and the content don match hindus may feeling prosecuted and marginalised but your article about the insidious harm casteism and baptism the opinion that the caste system would have been lot less prevalent today without the reservations economic reservation doing that our state essentials tells one more deserving simply birth this current sense victimhood combination factors the religious appeasement policies and the caste based appeasement policies ,Positive
you are right your observations but off the mark some group obc and forward caste members sensed that this would break the unity the hindu community and immediately diverted the issue ram temple which reminded them their common faith highly doubt that ram temple issue was created rift divide only conincidence that the just revived bjp from the ashes bjs needed issue survive they promptly picked ram temple issue because they wanted fight congress which was pro muslim kerala fortunes from hindu temples are nationalized for benefit all communities while those from churches mosques are tax exempt dear you are spot this one athiest but still feel one group society definetely victimised because this the marriage market where the truth about our divisions are magnified again spot the inclination assert one own social group the best can come from any human being earth excuses gdoms was the invasion tipu sultan which not now you are inside kerala history dont know thing there ,Positive

nice post however don think unfair minority appeasement has led directly the rise hindu fundamentalism but rather general hindu antagonism which tends lend itself well hindu fundamentalists for example there was post about how atrocious some aspects the rte act were about year ago remember like you mention actually discourages majority communities from running educational institutions and that for testimony sorts the genuine problem minority appeasement india does exist and ignore narrow minded stuff like that can really make the majority feel inferior and disadvantaged and that obviously will lead disenchantment and even discord that think where hindu antagonism ends hindu fundamentalism begins think when that opposition deliberate disadvantage twisted into generalized opposition the recipients the unfair advantage separate community whether nor they are adamant retaining that unfair advantage hindu fundamentalism and hindu extremists are reactionary they have played that reactionary role for long time mobilizing mass opposition specific thing into mass opposition the recipients that thing even when its usually disconnected and vote hungry political class that created that thing and its subsequent strife the first place like you said sometimes you may not deserve advantage accorded you over poor brahmin boy and sure many many many people share that opinion across all minority religions the problem always starts and ends with gross generalizations matter which side you just two cents ,Positive
 but does the mistake painting all abrahamic minorities one brush don they all believe that there this one supreme god who will give you salvation you believe him and act his holy book and otherwise will damn you hell isn this the reason for conflict between abrahamic religions among themselves and with other religions and also the reason for conversions ,Negative

from you comments here quite clear that you are not asking question but want people bash modi for not condemning the incident wrong and you are indeed asking question here what think about this live third world shithole called india man lynched for allegedly eating beef another burnt alive for entering temple yet another raped the age years and then there couple publicly hung from tree for marrying per their wishes these ghastly incidents are almost everyday occurrences here expect the prime minister condemn each and every incident you want him condemn the dadri incident because the victim was muslim and the issue was the much publicised beef ban dailt might want him condemn the hamirpur incident women might want him condemn the pilibhit incident who all does please and what will all this achieve have federal government with layers governance going down the level panchayats there are district officials and party spokespersons communicate the official views the prime minister has the overall responsibility the country and honestly speaking naive expect him get involved all this condemnation business and frankly even was tweet about this people who have anti modi agenda and who have been waiting for doomsday arrive will not view him his government any differently isn ironical that people are blaming the rather than blaming the under whose direct control law and order the state vests redditors would make you believe that everyone uttar pradesh and all across india was happily consuming beef and celebrating eid and diwali together till modi came power imposed the ban aroused communal feelings and caused one innocent man lose his life someone who lived his formative years western uttar pradesh let tell you that the animosity between hindus and muslims spans decades and has nothing with the bjp the rss you want glimpse this please read the pucl report the meerut riots which resulted the infamous hashmipura and maliyana massacre modi did not tweet criticizing the muslims who gunned down jain boy meerut the muslims who thrashed two jat boys death for resisting molestation their sister muzzafarnagar reverse the communities and would outraging about these incidents well ,Positive

 eat beef not really support beef ban however believe the protection hindu religious sites not necessarily mandirs ayodha kashi and quite few others are sacred places for hindus most these are not well maintained and there needs concerted government effort improve them far the ram janmabhoomi movement not sure that the birthplace ram but from the asi findings remember congress was power then clear that there was temple there efforts have been made reach out the muslim community provide them larger land area bigger mosque alternate site believe the best course will for hindu religious sites declared exclusive areas just like mecca vatican and resolve this issue ,Positive

supporter economic policy and governance part bjp selectively sympathetic their hindutva cause but frequently find myself disagreeing with their agenda this front against beef ban any restrictions society because their interpretation hinduism let people decide for themselves they should stop preaching morality and clothes also uncomfortable with most them being just political hindus and being atheist agnostic and indifferent their personal lives that being hypocrites that also dangerous frequently meddling hindu religion without believing god will not make such people compassionate they will just look things from cultural angle whereas the culture itself has become regressive lot ways okay you don believe god hinduism but that case not speak for hindus and hindu religion not talking about those who just beleive hindu kulcha and soch you aren hindu the context talking about know advani wasn great believer and know many the current bjp guys aren anyways are digressing ram mandir front think should just follow whatever the supreme court rules sure there was temple there which was demolished and then mosque was built upon that sure there are hundreds such places india but have move and some time stop seeking justice for atrocities committed past the same time beleive bjp efforts educating people about history and rewriting parts which have been intentionally twisted for agendas when people say there was temple there why the fuck you want one more temple deny that such things happened past strongly disagree but when they say fuck and let move agree minorities status and issue the end game have mind pretty simple equality for all that simple but still very controversial christians want proselytising they want bastar and tribal gujarat and convert people there christianity alright fine with but then let hindus and rss the same calling ghar wapasi xyz just semantics the hindus are using money for that fine christians that too but not fine they are using threat violence for now some liberals use the argument that christians shall allowed convert but not hindus hinduism never believed that bullshit and sinister the other thing want end game respect for each other the name liberty let not start drawing prophet cartoons and start pissing idols you are atheist okay fine but fucking keep yourself don make fun preach you are muslim keep yourself and will friends also favor ucc favor some compromises from all sides some hindus and many jains are strongly vegetarians respect that and accommodate them not having butcher shops beef festivals very close them muslims believe only one god and explicitly say there isn any other god that alright that what their religion but not bloody come and tell that god fake don office railway station have seen some christians that and any public setting keep yourself muslims should not forced prove that they are indians but they should also not give impression that they put another concept over country stupid things like not saying vandemataram talking about caliphate opposing yoga supporting the enemy country should avoided there are lot things hindus also need but this post isn about that limiting myself topic hand ,Positive

taking these petty issues seriously its the low hanging fruit for the lowest common denominator sane person the bjp camp even talks about these things hard bjp supporter including their religious agenda and let tell you brief how think greentext tiem india highly fragmented feudal and poor only ideologies make this diverse bunch behave like country slavery the name gandhi hindutva search your feelings and history and you know true ridiculous that foreign woman from different race religion country continent born and raised under different set cultural values for decades can come here under the banner gandhi and almost accepted our prime minister and was definitely accepted the head the most powerful political party india for over decade country diverse india predicted west balkanize somehow went through its bankruptcy and came out single nation state reason hindutva hinduism slavery name gandhi strong the abomination from the foreign whore literally cannot talk straight for than minutes literally makes sense all congress wants him the next prime minister their friends media intellectual circles and corporations end supporting him because they despise hindutva for real imagined reasons clearly congress has done and will more damage the country than hindutva can even imagine have good leaders hindutva modi and shah modi has actually proven himself gujarat done good work spread out over decade these can separate the rhetoric from reality advani was too much mandir movement modi uses hindutva gather support but does per wants good pragmatic politician now the rest how muslims must behave something according anyone who supports congress the enemy our nation state doesn matter how you give your allahus your akbars how you shove your jesus your christ how believing chubby kid with talking elephant head gives you meaning life you support congress then you are traitor book and you must eliminated any means necessary you support any other party then willing tolerate right now destruction neutralization the congress support infrastructure across political social and economic circles should our top priority now assuming the congress support infrastructure destroyed then and only then and not before rss becomes problem must eliminate them replaced better trained and equipped police force under independent judiciary but with covert powers hindu intellectuals become problem must eliminate them anyone who tries add religious talk education gets ass fucked hindu muslim christian cow piss magic bullshit earth 6000 years old and being pedo under special situations totally bro talk can and about this but won for the purposes this thread these points are enough and about ram mandir the rightfully hindu territory and will have back time the hate muslims have for american christian troops for polluting their sacred land mecca official motivation bin laden apparently the same hate hindus have against muslims for polluting our sacred land ayodhya only its worse our case because christians churches are not actually present inside mecca but muslims mosques are actually present the site ayodhya its also worse because christians came saudi arabia with the consent the government king whatever but muslims are staying ayodhya when have clearly stated that don want them there don give fuck where muslims choose live and build mosques india but atleast leave our sacred temples alone you motherfuckers don understand how this even for debate babri mosque culturally pretty insignificant muslims some mosque made name king but ayodhya and ram mandir are culturally extremely important for hindus the city 7th avatar vishnu who the preserver part the supreme being holy shit just give that small piece land and let worship our heroes and their flying monkey sidekicks why won muslims give possible that muslims think even the destruction single mosque for good infidel cause anywhere the world means that the holy war islam against infidels just took step back and that cannot allowed happen just imagine how much peace would there muslims let build our temple like holy shit can achieve many different goals simultaneously creates good impression hindu community discourages communal politics throughout india makes leaders like advani irrelevant rss and bjp loses good part its support you can emotionally blackmail hindus the future for reservations something this genius political and cultural move and yet muslims won this makes seriously question the loyalties muslims community seriously think they will demand another pakistan their numbers are high enough well just hope muslims begin rape and pillage europe soon that might see how the west reacts godhra style riot happens the west then they lose the moral right tell brownskins how deal with muslims and that gives our hindu right government that much free hand whatever the fuck wants ,Positive

whenever see statistics trying prove disprove something immediately grow suspicious numbers can played around represent whatever you intend show impossible conclusively infer from them now coming the numbers and chart that article please take look the source mentioned there htm tried playing around with the numbers just the author has done and realised number flaws first visually the chart wrong take look kerala has coefficient 2014 but the orange line does not dip below that region all the author forcefully trying prove trend secondly the methodology incidence communal violence given state given year from which subtracted its share the total population the country wrong you have states uts which have had incidences having different negative coefficients relative their population thirdly any statisticians out there back how does the number incidents correlate the population the state which means delhi meghalaya which have similar population will have the same baseline subtraction theoretically are taking for granted that the rate incidences similar populated states should same why this comes next point that indeed the data has shown like this then another variable the percentage muslim population the state also has taken into account guessing the author only intended focus hindu muslim conflicts and not hindu christian hindu buddhists now this will also show interesting fact the states uts with highest muslim population percentages lakshwadeep assam kerala actually fare quite well this study anyways after about one hour playing with the data was confused what objective was when started off because these data not really show any significant trend anything think the author mentions this the article well you can manipulate this data whatever extent you want and can show exact opposite trends what would question why are looking bad now worse than before have muslims been faring better the past and half year their more confidence between the communities now has inter communal relations become more hostile over this period these questions cannot answered these statistics ,Negative

this comment had posted earlier cents will try explain why think lost people seem quick criticize modi for communal problems india was born and brought mangalore communal tension common there every year used have school shutdown for few days and bajrang dal was and very strong there some small things like muslim boy marrying hindu girl hindu boy marrying muslim girl would tick people off from both sides and shit would escalate out control was from hindu brahmin family and even was afraid bajrang dal when modi came power there was massive rally these nutcase hindu groups many school friends participated this rally unfortunately and people this rally were openly saying things like now you wait and see what happens muslim neighborhoods they all think their time has come they all feel they won touched and that they have the pms support that why they have become extra bold modi responds strongly one incident against right wing just once come out openly and say something throw some these people jail these people will know not with their shit but unfortunately central government hasn done that both sides treat them both equally and throw people from both sides jail that even better but modi needs take strong stance against religious intolerance from both sides not the rise intolerance that the problem the fact that most these extreme right wing crazies think they have centers support and take center silence yes have seen and talked many bajrang dal mangalore and they truly believe and the other communities think they are under attack and also think the center supports the right wing sure center doesn support either side but silence not helping one clear and loud message from modi condemning both sides and rss etc for this will get everyone confidence back that edit lots comments cannot individually reply but some clarification not saying modi responsible not saying has apologize for every incident that crazy and unfair cant hold one person accountable for billion people that humanely not possible but because lot right wing crazies think modi supports them modi comes out and clarifies once and for all people will calm down right wing will know they dont have the support support dont mean legal support states duty many said and the minorities will stop crying that supports them someone below mentioned about discrimination against black community the example when black people went rampage obama did make statement that was not for black people riot like the way they were many people thought obama was support blacklivesmatter because black too but came out and said understands their frustration but was dead against their method showing that frustration actually came out and acknowledged the shitty behavior minority was doing even though black community hardcore supporters his own democratic party just modi coming out and openly criticizing these right wing actions will calm things down certain extent ,Positive

this what don get how that amit shah and other bjp leaders fringe not you decide saying these things are not damaging and when media reports damaging even selective reporting how media reporting about lynching greater wrong than the actual lynching itself ,Negative
does not matter these are all perceptions retards like bakra dutt and assdeep sardesai believe that india practically syria now and rss basically just cancerous version beyond point you cannot fight hyperbole since always based some real facts and oodles creativity there are just couple ways neutralize create enough good solid counter news progress women equality renewable energy etc work killing the base level factual realities perception dirty can fought with strict penalties peeing the streets throwing rubbish the roads etc modi just needs bulk and keep playing his game the game town not the dogs who bark him and small jpg ,Negative
 for this reason not opening his mouth adityanath sadhvi prachi mahesh sharma aside the somewhat saner bjp people like shah terms political correctness are having their statements misquoted and taken out context now imagine that happens the prime minister india when speaks within moments india whole will called communal state like isis all initiatives like swach bharat make india gone down the drain modi speaks misquoted doesn willing tolerate and encourage hindu hardliners and remember westerners almost always reads their news from the internet from news sites facebook thing worry about ,Positive
you should angry amit shah yogi adityanath etc for being such communal pieces shit and modi not saying word the issue rather the western media who report this ,Negative
like anybody cares about these news outlets ,Neutral
every party has its own ideals one cannot expect every single political party equivalently secular does seem like representing single community but the end the day they aren revolting against others india the biggest democracy and still surviving peacefully blessing itself ,Positive

such intolerance not new back the 90s when was high school were visiting small town tamil nadu and out shopping with some friends and made funny comment reference jayalalitha shop and was immediately told hush our hosts and once reached home was told that you shouldn say negative things about any politician public because their supporters are mostly goons who would cause problems having grown big city and school where regularly talked about current affairs and the first few minutes the school day were spent discussing the days top news stories was complete shock that you could get into trouble for merely speaking out and then ended moving tamil nadu for college and learnt that you should careful about criticising any tamil movies either you risked running into some violent fans the actors was happy move out there and have not have been the kind social circles where don have worry about speaking mind over the last few years social media has changed all that first started with iac and aap questioning anything about anna hazare and his lokpal was primarily met with name calling once aap came around got worse and then the 2014 campaign started and things just went rapidly downhill during the same period year period our cities have grown rapidly due immigration from smaller towns and villages and internet access which was mostly limited the urban elite became affordable the common man and this kind polarised say anything against favorite leader actor etc and round gang thugs and rough you scenario what most those people grew and for them this par for the course for political discourse and even though they have just found new medium express their views the way they remains the same the moderates will always just fly under the radar and avoid engaging with such elements look the bihar verdict bjp propaganda and their fanbois propagating would have you believe that modi and his plan the only way forward and anyone even questioning anti national and even the exit polls seemed endorse the view that this view was resonating with the population because only people already vocal about their views would readily submit any exit poll but the final results clearly showed that they were all wrong and the majority don care about this brand politics propaganda also there eleanor rooselvent quote great minds discuss ideas average minds discuss events small minds discuss people when have such large chunk the population that barely literate and education system that penalises independent thought you cannot expect have any kind normal debate policies plans with the average indian who raised never question authority status quo but they are definitely smart enough discuss events and how impacts them and react accordingly ,Positive

 addition what you read recommend river fire river water and shin buddhism bits rubble turn into gold both taitetsu unno also the reason why shin buddhist churches are even the because early japanese immigration and later sustained japanese american communities while they were placed internment concentration camps our government during ww2 they are called churches the first place that they could allowed established nation which had prejudice against non christian forms religion the churches continue source support for new japanese immigrants today the emphasis japanese american identity understandable found when going temples like this once they see not just tourist through frequent attendance and participating other activities they hold people get used ,Positive
amid all the stalling the upper house and the hoopla surrounding the gst bill this was perfect opportunity for bjp capitalize and show congress which the better party but they have pander their regressive religious vote banks and this pretty much what congress wanted when tharoor had tabled his bill ,Positive

 this will happen everyday this government slowly losing favor everywhere look bihar gujarat elections the policy looting the people corrupt bjp goons getting exposed now slowly evident matter who you choose when they come power they become corrupt because absolute power corrupts were chanting modi modi 2014 but its just year and have lost all faith this guy ,Negative

this why have game set use the japanese audio and just read the subtitles instead ,Negative
their voices and acting aren bad who cares they haven had experience before this you have start somewhere something you also failed realize that the actors are actually english this time instead faking english accents ,Negative
 know that voice from somewhere shrugs and keeps playing only know the voice actors that seem every single game arr and does not matter how long the voice actor resume are they all sounded mediocre horrendously bad ,Negative
all can say maybe those actors that were let were working other projects the time they were needed for and they weren available they had with alternative means that happens lot the business ,Positive
 concern that the casting change reflects mindset square that western audiences are not interested story and therefore worthwhile redistribution resources would move money away from english voice acting could this could that there are simply not nearly many english vas there are japanese and those who are vas are simply not well known because the role not remotely near prestigious english speaking countries japan this being one the very few times discussion about english voice acting has popped any discussion board anywhere and the relative lack passion getting outside the main post has doubt contributed very valid conclusion that the english audience does not concern itself with english voice acting anywhere near their counterparts japan mindset square that western audiences are not interested story not sure how you leaped this conclusion generally don tie the quality story the voice acting sometimes even live acting unless very bad and this game nowhere near that yet more with plot and visual effects and suspect nowhere near alone this least with western audiences ,Negative
 impressed with the amount effort you put into researching all that that being said english voice acting terrible investment while japanese voice acting good one this can seen all asian media including anime and movies the issue due the massive differences language because how drastically the feel the dialog changes translation you could get list actor and still have sound like complete shit good example this can found with english voice casts miyazaki films they are filled with very expensive list actors and the dubbing still kind sounds like shit compared the original ,Positive
 they simply decided that was not worth continuing with the previous cast proof there are many reasons that could possible that caused them with the new cast old cast busy not much more money spend voice actors actors wanting more money than willing paid etc clearly square treats its western and eastern audiences differently voice actors are treated much differently japan and america frankly surprise anime least the voice actors tend make several times more than any the animators and often more than the higher ups too ,Positive
 got the feeling that they just went one acting company for which would simpler and significantly cheaper than keeping lots ongoing contracts and possibly better result have evidence for this arr voice track was not memorable and neither don view big deal miss one two especially merlwyb voice actors anime are big deal japan their english knock offs are not there comparison unless trying compete with shrek pixar movie that not going happen ,Positive
somethign note here that sometimes experience doesn always equal quality you could end with things like miscast misdirect etc and the industry never cultivated newer talent then there point having voice acting industry begin with mean nobody fucking expected cristina vee well that she now iconic and recognizable laura bailey ffs also only narrowing down their experience video games terrible terrible way judging how good they are acting for example raw talent may not always have portfolio but someone notices their voice and gets them gig that one gig the seed that starts their careers and before they know they household name also consider other sources and don just mean the big screen either why don you consider things like theatre plays broadway musicals and the like not everyone has experiences that are recorded dvd some these you have see live even know they exist there reason patrick stewart performances are said have shakespearean vibe them that where majority his experience draws from real unfortunate that ends getting typecasted more often than not waste his potential given what seen out him don narrow your interpretation what can that will only bias your opinion into thinking they not capable enough take this role and besides even they weren experienced they never get chance show what they can you never know how good they could been ,Negative
ultimately feel comes down the voice acting scene and how differs between america and japan voice actors japan are idolized and fangasmed over our hollywood actors are and animation and video games are taken quite bit more seriously the eastern market compared the western for the video games part you really only have look south korea and the start the modern sports scene unless voice actor also well known live action star most western individuals would not able name that many voice actors until fairly recently animation the west has been looked down upon lesser art form possibly not even art form all depending who you ask and once again has only been comparatively recently that started seen more valid medium which express visual medium such our voice actor pool quite small now compare the eastern market animation well loved with long storied history that was taken seriously its market more less since the 60s not earlier with the advent televised animation series the voice actor pool for the eastern market huge and often entire career can made single animated series entire career nothing but animation voice work just have less those types actors around and they often have take whatever work comes their way continue their career leading gaps like this more than likely the previous actors were simply unavailable they were looking break out into more serious work the time could the mindset that animation and video game work still isn taken seriously the west though believe that slowly changing with pixar dreamworks could you say that square thinks don care about story ultimately think the problem lies with and our dismissal animation until fairly recently and the mindset western audiences regards cartoons there even problem all that has lead this gap ,Positive
 the only one who hates midgardsormr new personally felt had more powerful arr ,Positive
having list seiyuu license print money please understand ,Neutral
 english and some the arr voice acting was just beyond painful listen with couple exceptions the much better ,Negative
put this way when have such negative stigma for english dubs japanese works not surprising that square enix doesn feel like worth investing much money into hiring voice actors voice lines that may never heard ,Negative
honestly feels like they trying get new blood use regulars actually inclined worry less since has much higher quality voice direction than arr did with even portion the talent being well known ,Positive
 think would rather have consistency than talent and can explain why consistency makes for good experience moving forward suddenly changing voice acting casts ruins some the immersion voice actor dialogue isn working its the sound designer work with the voice actor fix the problem its the same problem with movies where actors get the blame for bad acting when the director the one calling the shots and giving the take the thumbs ,Positive
 feel that bit stretch draw that conclusion think the decision recast the english voice actors was more directorial decision rather than financial one the sudden shift can better seen the direction how square wanted english eorzea actually sound rather than just bunch american voices and accents accents thats the real hint all this heavensward you can really see how people from different places eorzea have different accents with their speech help stress the cultural differences notice how rauhban and ilbred both talk and pronounce way different from the rest the dah cast better yet notice how like half the cast just the voices from xenoblade they wanted more english cast american one ,Positive
snake gaius van baelsar want hayter mmo now ,Neutral
honestly having not heard the japanese voice work the game can weight one way another what astounds the sheer number people who think japanese sounds better default most the time japanese voice acting too fluid sound natural often missing delaying noises that most japanese use even when they don need delay their statement combine that with the lack social niceties most japanese dialogue animation and games and just feels bad take for example the animation rune soldier louie the english voice acting that far superior the japanese voice acting though most otaku term really hate use would argue the opposite from ignorance ,Positive
 remember reading they decided outsource their different studio for heavensward very likely that the one that recorded for xenoblade seemingly the last minute they probably did because was convenient for them terms costs and management honest with the exception few very good vas gideon emery will forever missed didn lose out much heavensward has been very solid compared arr with most the vas from xenoblade which had very high qulity dub itself joining the team ,Positive
 prefer lot the new voices the old voices tbh just because voice actor isn famous doesn mean they not good and gives newer chance get their feet the door difficult industry edit also the majority the casting changes are because timed contracts wearing out ,Negative
 disliked the voice acting arr much changed any other language but english don think much that they invest heavily japanese seiyuu but that the industry much more established japan seiyuu are also big draw for japanese players and some non japanese guessing whereas only know taliesin jaffe name and that from critical role ,Positive
 thought shtola sounded familiar ,Positive
 feel like that utterly bizarre conclusion draw the voice acting heavensward not bad any stretch the imagination and fact think lot people would argue better are the voice actors well known maybe not but anything more inclined give pat the back for giving new blood opportunity start getting some notches their belt big title rather than keep replying actors who are already established not mention honestly hearing the same every game can get tiresome itself ,Positive
well the thing that moved from mostly american based cast arr many whom were only vas anime video games british based cast comprised actors who are mostly and film actors tracy ann oberman merlwyb for example actress the and was several episodes doctor who among other shows gemma whelan igeyorhm plays yara greyjoy game thrones matt stokoe elidibus from the musketeers and misfits colin ryan alphinaud played major characters two series the leonardo and hounded anything the voice cast technically more famous the sense that they actors who are and film actors rather than just vas they just mostly happen british rather than american and therefore most people don recognize their names this actually more line with japan voice actors ,Positive
voice acting huge field general they don have out their way for decent vas not much the west they want talent compared they would have hire aaa celebrities just like disney and pixar when they have their animated films ,Positive

 kingfisher airlines borrowed amount 7000 crore from banks these loans were declared npa and the recoverable amount has come mere crore figure how much will recovered from the lakh crore the reason why this happened because mallaya used the trademarks and labels kingfisher collateral with the banks but the value these trademarks crashed when kingfisher went bankrupt now this goes without saying that brand name would lose its value goes bankrupt why did banks took the risk taking kingfisher trademarks collateral the first place when the loan was being taken for the vary same corporation the bench headed chief justice asked all there this indian express report well that strange supreme court bench drawing its conclusions from newspaper report ,Negative

 can add few points the banks dad chief manager public sector bank municipal town based branch managers chief managers don like having npas their books either the problem stems from the zonal level the zonal manager assigns quarterly yearly loan targets individual branches applications for larger and possibly good loans that are forwarded the zonal managers sit their desks for several weeks the borrower usually moves private bank now all that left smaller loan applications from shaky applicants local politicians who wants build schools engineering colleges and activists who would threaten write the this happened lot during the era the zonal management despite being sloppy still expects the branch managers meet the targets bms give the loan and hope would not become npa before they get transferred that the live bomb passed the new guy with bit negotiation with the auditing team and the zonal management you can avoid declaring few loans npa for bunch quarters and don even want speak about the crazy ones that retire branch managers they loaning spree ,Negative
while bad paper the current scenario actually better than expected the fact that banks have bad loans ancient fact life these loans extend many many places from large firms small farmers was always expected that some government would have intervene ecentually fix this the nda who has handle and fully expect them handle the issue itself resolved the bureaucrats and the bankers with the goi firmly the driving seat but the issue always the release bank funds largesse mainstay indian politics one form the other one the unspoken rules the game far the divestiture psus stronger oversight capital norms means constrain loans will help the clean banks will good thing and will allow for loan cycle occur the base healthy banking sector which can handle any future negative shock honestly this business expected good that people are upset but being upset won make difference since this essentially cyclical feature the larger economy and our banking private network rules which are followed divestment distance between center politics and psu management are the cure and they been the cure since the reform process started but haven been completed ,Positive

 always post this lecture article rajan the topic attitude borrowers towards the bank www outlookindia com article need change mind set 292696 the average interest rate loans the power sector today even while the policy rate the difference also known the credit risk premium largely compensation banks demand for the risk default and non payment since the unscrupulous promoter hides among the scrupulous ones every businessperson tainted the bad eggs the basket even comparing the rate the power sector loan with the average rate available the home loan obvious that even good power sector firms are paying much more than the average household because bank worries about whether they will recover loans reforms that lower this 300 basis point risk premium power sector loans vis vis home loans would have large beneficial effects the cost finance perhaps much more than any monetary policy accommodation also highlights general problems like regulatory forbearance which was put place for temporary use but has been abused again and again www livemint com opinion rbctubqqfy7moqw4uytq7h why regulatory forbearance must end html recovery rates psbs are lower than private sector banks but the latter isn all that higher either need better bankruptcy laws deal with this kumbhakaran you may want add these links you find them useful insightful ,Positive
 top vijay mallya just resigned from united spirits and got payout million rs515cr not pedantic but couldn resist because intermittent ocd sorry how can they ask the banks waive off loans worth lakhs crores without having estimate how the big defaulters are the banks know who are the borrowers and rbi does not this not issue secondly the loans are not being waived cancelled forgiven forgotten that wrong and dangerous word use this context the loans are being written off what that means you say earlier you post that once the borrower has failed service the loan willingly due the things can control the banks write off called provisioning could partial full that their and balance sheet show the true reflection their own health rajan pushing for aggressive approach you mention later the post that does not mean that the borrower walks away the banks continue make efforts recover the money through notices public shaming selling assets borrower change management restructuring conversion into equity court cases sale loan arcs etc loan part that has been written off the bank and the bank manages recover the amount written back and becomes profit for that year interesting example here would the business cycle mid 90s early 2000s that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually worse shape than today but fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most the bank clients turned around and banks averted disaster most borrowers were commodity companies that time steel cement etc this time this not likely happen the mess wouldn clear itself they could have taken measure make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money not only did they not take these measures they actually forced the banks lend their favored borrowers one the biggest defaulter unitech which people say gandhi family company rumor don ask for source group another big defaulter was close bsp jindals congress hcc pawar dlf huda vadra and they will benefit immensely from this loan write off and bailouts the government banks play the book which big ask they need not seize their fucking assets they have given personal guarantee seize their homes too what happens next short term government puts equity into the banks and they somehow survive medium term hopefully this government puts professional management into the top layers the bank board and cmd and the rot contained happening bank baroda but again tall ask long term the relative size the psu bank will shrink pvt banks will become bigger one last point why are politicians reluctant reforming privatizing the banks because that the biggest tool granting favors corporates who turn are the biggest political donors the last last point there silver lining the bank problem stock problem the loans already given are going bad and need deal with what the system does not have fortunately the flow problem new money coming into the system and the investment cycle picks will have the money fund ,Positive

modi hasn still released his roll number for rest all bullshit ,Neutral
fake degree fake entire political science lol ,Negative
the least the degree looks fishy jumla best looks like coverup given modi track record education first claimed that was university topper then the universities and pmo started blocking rti requests and then has kept quite all these days before this degree was shown wont surprised this comes out fake ,Positive
 refusing comment which weird bjp has played itself which also weird there are oddities the certs relating names and course names which also weird ideally would compare with other certs issued the same period for names fonts and roll numbers the roll number register combo should allow take stand which has not done double weird know doubting anything right would mean bhakts stuffing any open mouth with laddus abuse you dont ask question but somehow should wait for more details from the guys that did the issuing the certificates records room needs put under surveillance summer too much stake things are getting hot ,Negative
 will better the rti queries are answered rather than press conferences that will give ring authenticity the degrees and shut everyone forever ,Positive
call biased but just can buy that modi studied maybe some fakirchand college something associated with but certainly not the major colleges that said kejriwal top standard education has not really made him wiser person imo should have atleast confirmed his suspicions before launching all out attack politics makes the fools look saints and the wise look retards ,Positive
has also given the approval that the degree original ,Positive
 one finds weird that the degree was awarded for entire political science ,Negative
 man who actually gives funda about cosmetic surgery ganesha head cant more than 10th pass for and from gujarat univ cant believe for one sec,Positive
actually there should reasonable and substantial reasons suspect modi degrees the first place the aap have not proved that they have reasonable doubt but merely threw some allegations and are now stonewalling since the relevant degrees have been made public also the reasons why aap rti applications were turned down were because exhaustive requests that are simply tedious and without point like asking for the original application form modi etc this similar frivolous vexatious litigations that simply waste time and frustrate the defendants and have other objectives aap trying throw much muck see something sticks modi ,Positive
 predicted finally delhi university has confirmed the details just gujarat university had earlier delhi university clarifies modi was awarded degree 1979 html this should make everything clear normally however this whole drama due politics rather than any genuine concern over the degree expect congress and aap will just make the low effort argument that all this evidence fake cook some truly fake evidence their own and keep copy pasting these same allegations till the media gets tired ,Positive
 unfortunate that have clarify narendra modi qualifications shame that have clarify why unfortunate shameful what bad about asking for citations ,Negative
 was right when kejriwal upped the ante and showed the country how petty can even over non issues finally the degree has been reveled dispel all doubts wasn expecting amit shah personally get involved though the bjp should have asked some delhi state leader like harshvardhan show this just giving kejriwal unneeded legitimacy national politician way achieved his objectives with this drama ,Positive
 literally degree who the fuck cares you have degree not can you even get employed with all for academic research and the arts but has zero impact one ability perform competently ,Positive

fucking madarchods are now claiming that the degree forged top kek ,Negative
 really hoped that the bjp ministers had better things than respond some stupid trolling kejriwal the common man doesn give shit about collage degrees real fake ,Negative
 this whole degree fiasco don understand one thing have many almost illiterate politicians mean take sonia for moment she herself has idea what are her degrees but look the respect she has our country because gandhi dynasty sure there not going essay competition next election unless that what kejri bhai trying and kejri bhai won win that either you look politics only modi far far ahead from kejri bhai for one knows how run state the very least which think kejriwal don want only want sit the center before starts culminating corruption from country may abusing contest might see him clear winner ,Positive
the degree displayed may fake may not whichever you believe largely about your political leanings absolutely sure much more needs released like other documents which show modi registered external student etc and verification that the degrees shown are real and not fake and bjp may agree allow that too soon however all this sideshow with real relevance unless there forgery involved doubt that ,Positive

 bjp congress secretive team players not single word about the fcra amendment was spoken that day just like that super important law that will change how our political parties are funded was accepted the lok sabha proof any needed that bjp congress are different from each other they join hands and throw out democracy benefited them the ‘jumla’ that escaped not just jumla but the likes scam that this very bjp govt chased congress out power 2005 then modi abruptly announced that the gujarat state petroleum corporation gspc had discovered trillion cubic feet gas basin that the bjp promptly renamed the deendayal west area block which would generate revenue worth lakh crore for india everyone including the state and central administrations well subject experts was astonished this fantastic claim true such find would have made india energy self sufficient must for any country aspiring for super power status modi’ announcement therefore generated euphoric excitement and even shifted the narrative from him being the alleged mastermind the 2002 riots potential prime ministerial candidate fact given how events unfolded abundantly clear that the announcement like everything else modi does was just another exaggerated publicity stunt modiji pays heed exclusively his own mann baat thus ignored the field report and forced gspc ahead with the project because this gspc borrowed nearly 000 crore from different public and private sector banks and what does india have return nothing but the issue not just about modiji’ gaseous exaggerations also about diversion public funds and corruption after coercing gspc ahead with drilling basin modi forced partner with company named geo global now here’ the interesting bit geo global was reportedly incorporated just six days before the agreement with gspc the time entering into the agreement with gspc geo global’ capital was reportedly measly 200 week after the agreement its capital mushroomed 000 crore its report for the year ended march 2015 tabled state assembly this year cag had pulled gspc for its lack experience overseas operator the delay execution the work committed resulted cost escalations overseas blocks result the company had incurred expenditure 757 crore for surrendered blocks which 734 crore has been written off the apex auditor noted was this public money diverted fund modi ’ extravagant 2014 election campaign does this not merit independent high level judicial probe and even more interestingly when the screws were tightened vijay mallya for defaulting 9000 crore why gspc not being subject similar treatment why that instead its managing director was rewarded with appointment the director the national informatics centre state petroleum corporation deity gspc however desperately the bjp may sycophantically defend modi the bitter reality that under him corruption was rampant gujarat consider how gave 250 acres land restricted wildlife zone cronies the current gujarat for less than crore html similarly modi gave public land for the mundra sez ece which was worth 1500 per square metre for pittance anything between that why for years the cag was deliberately denied access numerous files gujarat and that also why under modi lokayukta was not appointed for years his avatar prime ministerial candidate modi had famously argued “main khata hoon khaane deta hoon” seems the truth different reports cag gspc 2016 20public sector undertakings report 2016 pdf cag gspc 2015 pdf cag gspc 2011 pdf ,Positive

gandhis are not the problem with congress they are merely the mascots congress steeped corrupt people from bottom ranks the top the entire congress party was die and fresh new untainted people were start new congress might consider them but until they have the likes pawars scindias singhs shuklas basically their entire leadership congress will keep looting india fuck that even when these shitlords are not power they keep corrupting the system from ministers they become brokers for corrupt babus you need permit something illegal meet with digvijay singh hand him briefcase cash and get your work done the right babu office ,Negative
 would you consider voting for the congress the dynasty gone this will never happen has been evident even from the recent loss they had having said that would still skeptical vote for them even after they eliminate the dynasty gandhis would still indirectly controlling their leaders when they come power their reach and influence within the congress cant eliminated totally ,Negative

 hindu feel that the secularism politics has often become tool for minority appeasement hold the view that indian culture inherently tolerant and secular don indulge conversion and believe that god can attained though many ways the same cannot said the abrahamic faiths who proclaim exclusivity and indulge conversions family itself has been victim where one relatives converted for reasons unknown bjp the only viable alternative who seem secular while preserving our traditions they don seem extreme painted the liberals and leftists seriously feel our population will echo sentiments and remain true bjp unless they indulge extreme corruption bigotry ,Positive
this moot point gandhi mukt congress likely dmk free the karunanidhi family rjd without lalu prasad yadav and his sons for national comparison bjp without rss and give the gandhis too much importance congress has lot other things wrong with them policies massive corruption political opportunism over national interests etc the blame for this also goes various second rung and regional leaders can replace them all ,Negative

let talk road paint from what remember from 2003 laborers literally painted the road instead using methods like thermoplastic painting wprov sfla1 thermoplastic markings are applied using specially designed vehicles usually thermoplastic marking mode should apply with equipment called road marking machine coating traffic lines and the road paint needs preheating device commonly called preheater the thermoplastic mix heated trucks about 200 ° 400 ° before being fed the application apparatus this often screed box ribbon gun immediately after the thermoplastic has been applied glass beads are laid onto the hot material that they embed before the plastic hardens these beads provide initial retroreflection the marking wears during use and the initial beads are lost the beads mixed with the binder are uncovered providing long term retroreflectivity most thermoplastic produced white and yellow colors but other colors such red may also produced the warm climate areas the thermoplastic markings can last years however snowplows can damage the thermoplastics which would limit the usage the cold climate areas there other methods tools they can use paint the roads too refer them here wprov sfla1 apart from obvious questions they think modi doesn know the roads are ugly mess and why these people such half hearted shit the more important question why don they just invest some form surface marking painting practice that has longevity instead having paint every year the regular paint gets worn out constant traffic dust and rains this what never got about india even thailand and georgia have better metalled roads with better signage texture and demarcations than what the glitch ,Positive

the whole drama surrounding the surgical strikes golden opportunity for investigative journalist joint team journalists from india and pakistan preferably containing cyril almeida and sreenivasan jain should investigate the matter truth about the strikes will then come out the whole release the footage release the footage smacks low effort erf ers and get detailed eyewitness accounts that your job journalists already report praveen swami out pakistani soldiers were killed want detailed report their death one indian soldier under detention pakistan interview him whichever reporter can fully get the bootom this incident pulitzer waiting him her like seymour hersh press lurkers get going your job fast ,Positive
 think the has conclusively settled this matter for anyone who would interested debating opinion that has fact put more time effort and thought into articulating this than the vast majority people who dispute the official version ,Positive
 false argument ’ still skeptical this was probably regular border raid the sort that have been happening for years not “surgical strike” the army claims the difference that they chose publicize this time known fact that ech and dee huge factor that nation but the end what will work what good friend used say give peace chance ,Positive
 however india fact carried out cross border surgical strike terrorist facilities and not pakistani military posts would paradigm shift india’ war against terrorist and militant organizations would also boast the perception that india’ asymmetrical warfare capability further along than many may perceive doesn know shit just speculating,Positive

the dumbest thing this whole discussion the military prerogative provide not any details could have chosen altogether not talk about the covert operation just mention that has been done may have chosen the former and not the later for whatever analysis and planning has this always ongoing live situation and not year old record which has only historical relevance military has need provide proof anyone other than the government which accountable since democracy there civilian oversight the military through the elected government about what has not carried out video their operations can compromise the identity individuals involved details their modus operandi capabilities etc and sane military will voluntarily put such information public domain and there nothing that will realistically achieved indulging chutiya demands anyway rabble makers all unrelated note its almost like asking video proof honeymoons ,Negative

 close friend mine army officer posted told that the army had issued orders couple days after the uri attack all units send family members home this was just regular operation there way the army would take such precautions was well thought out and well executed operation real shame that some politicians are more interested scoring petty brownie points ,Positive
brilliant point point breakdown one other argument making the rounds false argument okay maybe the strikes took place but should have been kept secret and deniable there good reason for dgmo make statements about covert actions except for bjp score political points there are massive number reasons make strike like this public exposes pakistan bluster just tough talk for all their talk being high alert for indian troop movement along the loc after the uri attack they didn even see coming massively boosts morale within the armed forces morale which has been getting steadily lower our bases kept getting hit while they were not allowed take charge the offensive the troops are also being vilified the media national and international while trying control spiral violence srinagar fueled pakistan propaganda machine makes the best use pakistan blunder overreaching and outmaneuvers them pakistan has its hands tied now after making bold statements about defending against indian adventurism aggression and denying that any terrorist camps even exist the region that they have the support their government pakistan has left itself publicly admissible out can either promise retaliation for strikes thereby confirming the existence such terror bases deny the strike and claim ignorance any bases the area releasing statements and evidence the strikes india makes pakistan look weak and incompetent defense while also making the point that pakistan harbors terrorists and uses them proxy war against india manner that exceeds just providing moral and diplomatic support they have claimed the past calls pakistan bluff threats start nuclear conflict their nuclear arsenal while still being very real and implicit threat longer their impenetrable shield striking within pok and then making public india has taken control the escalatory ladden you said earlier out the open for everyone see which leads the next point makes public the strategic shift indian policy dealing with cross border infiltration and terrorism this now means that india controls the play events and that infiltration will actively fought against taking the fight the terror outposts and leaving open the possibility even striking training camps situated further inland this means that india will make pakistan work and pay for every infiltration attempt literally not just pay terms revenge and bloodshed pakistan will need actually spend more time money resources manpower actual defense and surveillance near these bases their terror outposts will have constantly vigilant and more resources dedicated keeping eye out for incoming strikes the future this very different from the past where the outposts had nothing worry about till they crossed the border and their entire focus was offensive not defensive nature points out very little fencing the pakistani side because they never even felt the need defend themselves but that will all change now terrorists will not sleep peacefully their beds they will possibly make more mistakes and every new person recruited keep watch patrol their perimeter potential vulnerability too accidentally leaked info paid informant mole many these will make increasingly expensive and difficult maintain multiple such bases leading demoralized terrorists demoralized pakistani troops demoralized and disillusioned pakistani public pakistan currently damage control mode firing off more propaganda than artillery and trying pooh pooh the stories the strikes indian propaganda but inaccuracies their accounts will begin add and morale will definitely take hit everyone the pakistani side currently denial but that expected ultimately again makes the government look dishonest incompetent and erodes their imaginary moral high ground that they lay claim strengthens the indian public support for the government this definitely well deserved win for the bjp but more importantly makes the indian public lot more unified behind their central government regardless who was power when such action was taken there are certainly plenty who question the narrative and events but there definite surge public approval favor retaliation for uri and the strikes themselves regardless their position the who how where why covert overt bragging courting war etc this demonstrates among other things that the goi proactive that was receptive the outrage about uri across the nation that was willing take stand such attacks indian sovereignty demonstrates india ability operate within the bounds previous agreements and treaties while still taking decisive action defend itself and not being enslaved those treaties pakistan has always played victim when came any border related issue and deny any involvement previous incursions from their side meanwhile india hamstrung restrictive treaties preventing military retaliation for numerous actions carried out pakistan and its proxy fighters till now this deft navigation not altering the loc while striking terrorist camps falls well within the bounds the simla agreement and the charter surgical strikes across loc line with shimla agreement and charter 3026586 html exploring this avenue publicly means that india can now freely continue perform such strikes the future without invoking any backlash from most other nations and getting active support from several now let assume that the strikes took place but the government kept absolutely secret the outcome not making the strikes public knowledge would have been quite disadvantageous the whole india maintains deniability for aggressive action great but pakistan will constantly play the victim anyway portray cross border terrorism domestic rebellion foment unrest and paint india oppressive bully state committing atrocities kashmir very little advantage here while the strike killed handful terrorists and prevented few attacks the near future would fail adequately capitalize that victory other terror outfits and individual members such organisations may remain unaware and unafraid pakistani turf terrorists sleeping soundly before attempting border crossing isn good for indian defense maintaining state combat ready vigilance and tension impossible for more than few days for all but the most highly trained soldiers demoralizes indian troops they would feel abandoned the govt and the people left deal with bloodthirsty militants all themselves without any chance take action and preempt such attacks the indian soldiers continue the only ones who sleep fear with the fatigue constant vigilance making them weaker while the enemy gets stronger indian silence taken for weakness emboldens our enemies india seen soft target home and abroad india loses control the narrative the few who would aware the covert action the other side could later alter the narrative they have done several times the past and claim india committed atrocities and crimes pakistani territory and killed civilians blaming raw and other agencies and using justify further attacks several years the future the context and events this time would have faded from the public mind and india would the diplomatic back foot having either deny the action ever took place and look guilty forced justify such action and remind the public that was retaliation for uri not random unprovoked attack better claim upfront and connect the two events inextricably forever india retaliates for uri massacre today lot better than india denies committing war crimes pok years later when the conspiracy theorists would have had plenty time concoct alternate narrative pakistan would continue have the facade nuclear shield despite successful strike until challenged head publicly pakistan claims would continue hold weight pakistan retains control the escalatory ladder pakistan bluff not called and continues project the image competent military pakistan retains the facade harboring terrorists its soil what terrorists public acknowledgement shift the policy strategic restraint indian public loses faith the government not knowing about any retaliation would mean that the indian public would just have another item list complain about how the government all talk action critics the government perceived restraint would continue make the government look weak and ineffective bjp would crucified the public eye for not taking stronger measures because the public wouldn know about the strike the voice the people would appear have been ignored future governments would unlikely continue the shift strategy reluctance take control the offensive would persist continued veil secrecy would mean that their efforts would unnoticed while the costs and risks such operations would for little political benefit ,Positive
also tangentially support your first argument the fact that even there was attack claiming one itself bold diplomatic move challenging the other side escalate especially during times heightened tensions ,Positive
let face the isi and its indian supporters will never ever accept the truth even video the operation released this has become prestige issue for them and like with ishrat jehan they will never accept the truth already those who believe the strike happened are being called bhakts the larger issue how deal with this fifth column ,Neutral
lol the downvotes are from modibots,Positive
 completely agree with whatever you have posted only issue with the chest thumping and increasing politicisation the issue modi took bold step everyone appreciated then the bjp went overboard with all their sources leaking incredulous information and now you see them using this plank for the next elections what does lead even more politicisation from the other parties who are obviously feeling insecure they can one this especially when comes army which enjoys the electorate respect tactically and strategically this was excellent political handling was utter shit ,Positive
some thoughts been having the indian army apolitical organization the extent that there are laws restricting army men from expressing political views while service that widely held more credible such matters than the political class the elected government when the director general himself not the defense minister bjp spokesman called that press conference should have been accorded respect not immediate suspicion while the army has had fake encounters and other crimes before there precedent seniormost army figures lying the public serious matter like this while have right question our armed forces the degree suspicion this case was unwarranted and unnecessary and belies the agenda the critics rather than the army most the people having any cursory knowledge about such operations know that detailed information photos video etc are rarely released due being sensitive confidential military matter that could compromise the capabilities the armed forces and intelligence agencies revealed they can shared with relevant authorities but not the general public because that way these secrets will exposed the enemy well was very irresponsible doubt the dgmo insinuate that the attacks were fake and ask for detailed evidence what apparent just under the surface but which one will say out loud that this whole controversy only due politics the modi government started capitalizing the goodwill from the surgical strikes for election campaigns yjr left wing parties politicians and followers are trying counter the bjp political mileage calling the surgical strikes fake and the army lying modi stooges matter shame that has even come this but the media publishing eyewitness accounts from pok still regarded rss conspiracy ishrat jehan innocent girl the terror boat incident staged yakub memon heroic whistleblower burhan wani youth icon etc sections the liberal class india ,Positive
you might want add the list pakistani denials the following they have denied and continued deny the presence pakistani army regulars 1947 they denied any knowledge about the existence osama before his death continues deny any knowledge his presence just stone throw away from their biggest staff college army cantonment coincidentally the has released evidence neptune spear and fact takes action against soldiers who even leak info kargil they denied the presence nli unit regulars refused accept their bodies but later gave them the fucking nishan haider their pvc how stupid that lastly pakistan has denied the presence terrorist infrastructure their soil admitting these strikes something they will never ever how can they admit attacks phantom sites they have maintained does not even exist pakistan kejriwal the congress and the communists are opportunist scumbags putting party and politics over the army and national security ,Negative
this whole denial thing actually worked out well for kills their narrative indian aggression while alloys conduct similar operations the future without international scrutiny ,Positive
 the director general military operations dgmo made official announcement stating the statement offers plausible deniability crossing the loc one could argue for strikes such cros border shelling etc the main implication crossing the border during these terrorist attacks and infiltration attempts have recovered various stores including gps and items that clearly indicate their origins pakistan which when closely examined also leaves hazy which infiltration attempt when and where material was recovered would say this plausible official deniability purpose the strategy was let jingoistic media the talking without any official source ,Positive
why the media jerking themselves over this incident which may may not happened have millions other social evils report about ,Negative
 this was not just regular border action that uninformed commentators and analysts are speculating those were tactical nature and were planned and conducted the initiative local commanders how you know that you can compare between this operation and the previous operations you knew the details the previous operations and have knowledge about the previous operations therefore any comparison pure speculation the sole reason why this time different that indian government made the existence and the details military operation public could have kept secret but indian government chose reveal the details let address the video evidence indian army publicly claimed that they have the video the cross border strike now per your argument the video evidence will not change pakistan stance denial they will continue deny even reveal the videos the act revealing the video contents will have effect pakistan reaction then why reveal the existence the video army could have stayed silent about the existence such evidence india conducts cross border strike like has done before and makes public within few hours which hasn done before india also publicly claims record the video the strike while also knowing that revealing such video would have effect pakistan state denial how make sense these contradictions well actions and utterances after the military strike indicate that india doesn want outright war case did want war with its nuclear armed neighbor then the genius our policy makers beyond the human realm beyond the understanding mere mortals this entire business was conducted making public the military operation making public that have the video for the domestic audience there impending polls two major states there discontent among students dalits minorities marathas patels how unify these warring factions why not make military operation public india should decide using military means influence domestic politics precedent worth setting ,Negative
you missed the most important question how know whether the targets are actually terrorists launchpad can simply house village hut forest simply launching surgical strike something you define launchpad does not mean actual terrorists were hit the second important question how many innocent people were killed injured this surgical strike assuming there some meaningful difference between surgical strike and plain ordinary strike does mean innocents were killed injured how know ,Positive
neutral observer here wandered here after newspaper story and reddit thread and followed with bit research here are two cents nytimes and wapo story noticed that the visit the border was under pakistan army supervision and journalist posed any independent question the locals not think army would leave any bodies around and terrorist camps lying around when journalists visit they were pushing pretty unbelievable agenda and journalists did not any investigative journalism when comes pakistan wise untrust them they even denied usama bin laden presence why would indian dgmo issue statement they hit launch pads territory under their control understand there are lots sensitivities due both being nuclear states and hence the statement being mild avoid annoying various powers this was the same terminology used when india hit myanmar camps another major point was that some other nations were immediately briefed india definitely hit pakistani side these strikes ,Positive
the real question why are people worked that some are questioning the army narrative believe the questions are relevant since bjp will use poll issue the upcoming elections ,Positive

good post people need realise that government can really declare something out thin air has geopolitical consequences and pretty sure the decision have surgical strike and also declare about this attacks was well thought and was made pretty experienced people who actually know what they are doing whether not this was right wrong completely different issue personal opinion this they attacked responded really well celebrated and this got really good public response which isn wrong imo matter closed let get back diplomacy instead escalating this have lot more better things worry about ,Positive
 agree that the indian govt has hinted strongly that they did cross the border and there chance that decent sized operation did occur however there can and never will 100 proof indeed hope these ops will always deniable and based the pakistani reactions suspect that they just sucked because otherwise they would lose face front their public pakistani establishment are certainly capable playing this game for their domestic gallery for example after osama killing americans they basically denied all knowledge the raid and they would have denied the american role wasn for the crashed chopper whereas suspect they were aware the raid and had bartered osama life for something the other ,Positive
you forgot add pakistan army and govt and media also rejected for like one month that afghan taliban head mulla mansur was killed baluchista march 2016 and they kept fooling their country with fake technical issues like the dna wasn matched with afghan head mulla mansur and shit like that confirmed that and did world media but pakistan being pakistan you know dick lied the world ,Negative

 disclaimer this was intended response cynicism expressed leonorachristine but their comment got voted down into oblivion copy pasting for better visibility think all lies the perspective because india technologically less advanced than lot western countries has lot less baggage and easier move cleaner energy sources currently the indian government driving electrification through all villages india you look 2016 and has already been years since india became independent even then there lack such basic amenity however the energy ministry here doing stupendous job you could look the facebook page the concerned minister who shares electrification stats for every week india still energy deficit there need even build the infra that would provide for the energy needs the country adopting clean energy very easy for that way modi trying build world wide presence ratifying the paris climate agreement and following through implement would give his government greater foothold world politics india already ramping its effort become part nsg gain much more access nuclear energy already special place the nsg members are free trade nuclear material with india the way see quite possible that modi will follow through his words and receives technological support india would fact lead the world moving clean energy and you mentioned toilets doing great lot work about that too ,Positive

 you find this fuckery wait see them post retirement that atleast they could enjoy the freedom flexibilities they don wake same every damn day even not feeling well sleep same 1030pm every damn night even nice movie they like turn the same three channels same five bhajans same coffee reminds that fast fwd routine scene tamasha movie parents like listening music wanted buy them good speakers gave speakers small but good them for month try before buying new better ones for them did the setup showed everything just one knob they didn even turn for full months whatsapp seems give them the kicks these days almost everyday mom talks about one other thing she saw there and half the time end explaining how that forward patently wrong nevertheless something talk for 15minutes they rant about every cousin age buying big big ipad etc for their parents their age when offer the same they refuse speakers try not tried new gas stove not even unpacked what more can just gave spending cpu cycles thinking how make them happier looks like the only next step getting married soon but not like any the profiles their astrologers approve that different rant thread stopping here ,Positive
 cents instead pushing them towards wholesale change lifestyle why not start slowly for example you said taken pranayam maybe get him into local yoga group motivate them exotic pilgrimage locales like kailash muktinath and they might develop affinity towards nature and they can then motivated non religious treks hopefully this also gets them widen their social circle and they motivated different things ,Positive
same case here bigger fear will turn out the same way ,Neutral
wow used have exactly the same concern year ago still some extent but here are the initiatives took help parents have fun time also saw mom just roaming around the house doing errands pass time just sitting idly the balcony could relate how painfully bored she used get weekends after heavy work week one the steps took was sign her facebook best decision ever she spends least half hour every day facebook she found lot her long lost friends and stays updated with relatives next got her smartphone and got her whatsapp that too turned out well got her tablet recently because the phone was too shitty operate and whatsapp she uses the tablet for and occasionally plays games besides introducing her the digital world often take her out dinners fancy hotels malls for shopping some recreational locations etc this kind hard due time constraints but always try put family time the top priority list because nothing else more important than spending time with your family precious fleeting and often you don realize what you got until you longer have tried coaxing her into movies but she doesn seem into show her funny and interesting videos youtube introduce her different kinds music and yes take whole lot initiative from end and that only how works can never expect mom ask things want something she simple like that try give what she doesn ask for ,Positive

also there another perspective ponniyin selvan says here perhaps some trying see through our lens how would spend retired life when have this much money free time versus why are parents doing only these mundane stuff day after day after day show some stuff that they might find interesting forcing here just like how parents try need introduce several perspectives life avenues learning their children esp during long holiday breaks senior children want try show them more variety more interesting ways spend their time there some years time for healthy active retired life and then some more listen music really nice headphones naa ears will bad okay with old cracky speakers new types movies are releasing these days try some naa this impractical action movie that way too sad movie what this silly comedy that family movie just like our home too much love romance who does life try these books read your pace find out which genre you like what get reading their friends have moved away some them passed away known long time neighbours have moved what used calm laid back town during their young age now busy crowded noisy town not city like bengaluru they feel baffled their own place you get the idea agree they cannot accept the entire platter change their entire lifestyle routines but sad when they even refuse sample any those things try introduce and then there this thing during phone calls that aunt went foreign tour this uncle went ten day yoga camp forest their son gave big phone etc that what ticks off guess need put listen only cap and move with our busy lives ,Positive

this seems similar was actually painful read same story here moved out almost years ago now living own mumbai thousand kilometres away visit home maybe once twice year and always makes sad same shit you whatsapp happened both parents who are very well educated doctors turned into modi bhakts and became sort bigoted dad more than mum dad has hobby though but has become too clingy keeps saying that another years and then will retire and settle with but don want his life that just seems sad want him explore india the world like used his teenage but that part him gone now mean understand its because cares for but don want him live life where waits for come back home from work and sit around home all day want him learn new stuff travel and whatnot but that part dead seems now its pretty sad and have clue how reverse this ,Negative
 advice you something different from seek advise like good boss does not delegate but challenges team with task keep dad mom super busy physically and mentally discourage father from riding bike picked walking and daily walks approx dad and mom both walking for shopping movies which hardly half don force anything but rather seek their involvement was scared dad riding ,Positive

best tip can give anyone with solid but predictable language would imagine actually functioning with people culture etc are they isolated from other language families maybe they have their 100 germanic language and one day they are introduced japanese something and they take the things they like and try and mash them together maybe they develop writing system that only works for one their accents and the same symbol represents several sounds depending where you are stuff like this not only can help you spice your language terms sound word structure but also any rules you have will end with exceptions you might end with synonyms and homophones and those are very naturalistic things ,Positive

edit this was first time expressing political view reddit should all try understand the point view the other side without animosity you can keep calling modi fenku but honestly doubt that modi cares much whether you call him fenku jhantu gandu don have keep talking about the problems our country faces guys can also part the solution here pull off trump card soldier soldier bol dia koi argument bacha nahi much hate the discomfort that this demonetization has caused think should still let bjp run the country really believe that they need more time and people need more time assess their leaders bold steps might bad like this demonetization one but bold steps are necessary for any significant change the country the propaganda around modi ridiculous but what are the alternatives are probably more informed than people living the villages and should use choose lesser the two evils also think that our media has blown things out proportion many instances love have some bold steps taken make sure that the fourth pillar democracy remains impartial criticizing government important but sensationalizing everything only going make things more and more difficult and please avoid using the bhakt title for anybody who thinks modi apt for the country this moment mud slinging only going take all further away from the opposite point view ,Positive

just like mao think modi also oblivious the large scale suffering that this move has caused loss jobs loss productivity decrease demand etc has surrounded himself with many yes men that impossible know whether knows about the tragedy that has occurred result his actions however the changing narrative the government and shifting the blame does indicate that modi gradually realizing the futility the demonetization exercise ,Positive
thanks for your view points remember article how govt china makes the shopkeepers mandatory dispense out lottery tickets issued govt that they can keep track transactions stop tax evasion businesses think universal that people hate pay taxes and the same time hold sense entitlement when comes receiving services from govt understand the discussion little more 500 1000 notes constitute the currency true however how much stored used day day result this situation like this money does not get transacted taxes collected are lower that fine government can keep printing notes this what exactly happened earlier via mnrega and other welfare schemes only creates situation later when large amounts money floods market product inflation will raise this can observed items that people who have hoarded wish buy one cannot buy more perishable goods than required inflation these items not considerable this can also change when cold storage become more prevalent let say onion market onions can hoarded with hoarded money depriving taxes government not registering the transaction you can rig the price what done here not paying taxes you have additional money which goes onto create inflation while govt unaware unaware has record cornering market known problem indirect tax has important function helps determine price market the transactions are not recorded breaks the price discovery while can say market economy should correct this there real free market the world except econ 101 this would not problem currency had expiry date does now are here and now while you can talk world will end won because human tendency work for any compensation the labor rate falls tomorrow there still supply soon the real value labor will discovered ,Positive

you are not entirely wrong far the analogy goes the comparison demonetization with mao campaign appropriate spirit old kind politics the one many thought had become unfashionable after reforms and subsequent liberalization has returned this the politics hammering the economy without worrying about subtle and indirect impacts accompanied with the rhetoric moral victory and sacrifices politics first subordinated institution and now has again managed subordinate the economy one abrupt act the government has managed hit the livelihood millions and this comes from party which promised less government seems that they didn understand their own message tempting conclude that demonetization was one off decision bad this mistake will not repeated hard agree with this conclusion once the beast out cage there stopping and politicians very often become captive their own rhetoric ,Positive
modi has shifted his focus from anti corruption since this move backfired bad within few weeks deployment and bjp are now big time promoting cashless move see this campaign everywhere from radios internet the end the month people will believe modi never made this demonetization move control black money and corruption but promote cashless economy which infact did gather support for upcoming state elections ,Negative
just last months have had uri attack then boycott china demonetisation black money demon cashless india and now will whatever finally whatever year won remember anything though this might take bit longer randi rona lasts more than couple months india only constants our life are soldiers and 6lpm ,Positive
 appreciate your thoughts outsider here but disagree with you what weak analogy sure there something like personality cult however democratic set ups any set really leadership some level about creating followership disagreement with your analysis the lack criticism and the steel demonetization bit india has lot built criticism mechanisms not like the chinese controlled system not yet but much closer that than chinese system look any indian newspaper and you will see starting diy steel manufacturing very different than money supply issue the whole thing will settle down couple more months may another year tops steel competes with global steel there competition inr india again not saying that this could not disastrous but the mao glf simile stretch the least ,Positive
great leap forward really chinese dude maybe you don understand but india real democracy and modi policy are even remotely disastrous glp the parliament would dissolved and mass protests would break out every major city nda cannot hold power without the people support please bullshit someone else ,Positive

hey man the demonetisation knocked few points off the gdp growth rate and there some temporary suffering rural india which reducing the day not modi supporter who supports everything does even though feel the implementation could have been better differently believe this positive step this needs followed with more actions tackle corruption actually the great leap forward was totally different scale and the social engineering that was being done the commies was vastly more dangerous cannot really compared with this demonetization plan which pretty much winding down these days also you right saying that the rich people are going find loopholes but believe this action nets about the rich people who stow away cash follow they should digitize land records and rationalize gold and shares held stock market too these are the primary places where black money stowed away ,Positive
frankly you are missing the point ridding the economy physical cash all about getting the money into bank accounts physical cash money issued directly the central bank bank account money derivative money multiple getting people hold savings banks gives banks power leverage those savings and create more money for themselves happening now everywhere the planet because the banking system highly coordinated also why the indian government soft banning gold gold real money and outside the banking system the global bank cartel has already created far more debt than can paid back the currencies have today value real terms two things will happen currency will radically devalued even usd eventually and every scrap real economy must brought into the banks india going through the same everyone popular powerful leader borrow spend tax leverage all the benefit the money cartel the stock and flow physical notes does not aid the banks bank accounts ,Positive
one major point disconnect mao didn have back the people months after executed the great leap forward modi wants elected this move disastrous his critics are arguing they should secretly happy right months not enough time for the public forget how many their relatives lost their lives standing queues just clear and how all the black money holders they the common public have not suffered any material loss was huge supporter this move when announced still about favour the action agreed that there going quarters depressed growth agreed that probably most the has been laundered the move still makes sense can set out the reasons another post democracy enjoys public trust his actions will have consequences may 2019 will show whether squandered the trust enjoys that trust affirmed ,Positive
bhai mere demonetization has already failed only the government insists beating the dead dog high denom money likely deposited back into the system showing how the whole black money objective was badly missed top that the severe hit the informal economy will shrink our gdp well this miserably failed scheme ever there was one but thats what you get when you have trp based governance ,Negative

his boldest reform since coming power 2014 when announced the abolition high value banknotes 500 and 000 rupees and came bolt from the blue the secrecy was aimed outflanking those who might profit from prior knowledge pouring cash into gold property and other assets and hide illicit wealth previously unreported details modi’ handling the called “demonetisation” open window onto the hands role played implementing key policy and how was willing act quickly even when the risks were high while some advocates say the scrapping the banknotes will bring more money into the banking system and raise tax revenues millions indians are furious having queue for hours outside banks exchange deposit their old money labourers have also been unpaid and produce has rotted markets cash stopped changing hands not enough replacement notes were printed preparation for the upheaval and could take months for things return normal with india’ most populous state uttar pradesh holding election early 2017 that could decide modi’ chances second term office there little time for the hoped for benefits his cash swap outweigh short term pain modi has staked his reputation and popularity the move “ have done all the research and fails then blame ” modi told cabinet meeting nov shortly before the move was announced according three ministers who attended direct line modi overseeing the campaign with support from the backroom team camped out modi’ sprawling bungalow the capital was adhia top finance ministry official the year old served principal secretary modi from 2003 when was chief minister gujarat state establishing relationship trust with his boss and introducing him yoga colleagues interviewed reuters said had reputation for integrity and discretion adhia was named revenue secretary sept 2015 reporting formally finance minister arun jaitley reality had direct line modi and they would speak their native gujarati when they met discuss issues depth the world’ largest democracy the demonetisation was revolutionary called into question the state’ promise “pay the bearer” the face value every banknote stroke modi scrapped money worth trillion rupees billion equal percent cash asia’ third largest economy the idea backed some economists although the speed its implementation widely seen radical “one never ready for this kind disruption – but constructive disruption ” said narendra jadhav year veteran and former chief economist india’ central bank who now represents modi’ party the upper house parliament modi his address the nation cautioned that people could face temporary hardship replacement 500 and 000 rupee notes were introduced calling for act collective sacrifice promised steps soften the blow for the nine indians who live the cash economy “biggest boldest step” immediately after the address adhia sent tweet “this the biggest and the boldest step the government for containing black money ” the boast harked back modi’ election vow recover black money from abroad that had resonated with voters fed with the corruption scandals that plagued the last congress government yet office struggled keep his promise over more than year modi commissioned research from officials the finance ministry the central bank and think tanks how advance his fight against black money close aide said demanded answers questions such how quickly india could print new banknotes how distribute them would state banks benefit they received rush new deposits and who would gain from demonetisation the topics were broken prevent anyone from joining the dots and concluding that cash swap was the offing “ didn’ want let the cat out the bag ” said senior official directly involved “had people got whiff the decision the whole exercise would have been meaningless ” under adhia’ oversight the team researchers assembled and modeled the findings what was for theoretical exercise was made young experts data and financial analysis some ran modi’ social media accounts and smartphone app that used solicit public feedback yet for all the planning modi and adhia knew they could not foresee every eventuality and were willing move swiftly the announcement caused chaos with huge queues forming banks when they reopened after short holiday new 000 rupee notes were hard come and barely any new 500 rupee notes had been printed india’ 200 000 cash dispensers could not handle the new smaller notes and would take weeks reconfigure them filling atms with the trillion rupees billion new banknotes that the finance ministry reckons are needed restore liquidity the economy even trickier best case scenario which india’ four banknote presses churned out new 500 and 000 rupee notes designed replace the abolished ones would take least three months hit that target secrecy paramount secrecy was paramount but clues had been left back april analysts state bank india said that demonetisation large denomination notes was possible the reserve bank india the central bank also disclosed may that was making preparations for new series banknotes that were confirmed august when announced had approved design for new 000 rupee note the printing presses had only just started turning when the media finally started run with the story late october “the plan was introduce around nov but there was clear sign that could get leaked ” said one person with direct knowledge who like others interviewed reuters asked not named due the sensitivity the matter some officials the finance ministry had expressed doubts about scrapping high value notes when the idea came for discussion they now feel resentment the secrecy which adhia rammed through the plan modi’ orders they also say the plan was flawed because failure ramp printing new notes ahead time

 tiss citizen what that sound citizen think that was our bubble ,Positive
 still think the right intent there but for the implementation succeed you need the right team with right skills and this where think modi should understand his limitations and beyond his team but sadly that not happening may because has very low trust quotient most authoritative rulers have very low trust quotient add that weak opposition which would cause lot complacency and think that what has happened tldr right intent but less skills know all attitude complacency,Positive

first thing supported was the surgical strikes but then bjp started openly milking for political gains and started becoming suspicious that this not new and the only difference this time chest thumping then nov 8th was pleasantly surprised that actually going after black money but then the days passed learned how this foolish plan that cannot achieve the stated objectives and that too lacked any kind preperation planning and foresight the worst thing about modi thinks indians are idiots and believes that can shamelessly get away with any kind ridiculous lies ,Negative
one simple explanation probably arrogance sometimes power gets into your head and you start rationalizing dumb decisions same thing happened congress leaders their second term ,Negative
 fair give modi more chances his intentions seem right demonization was never easy thing and not that have landed crisis hope modi brings more stronger steps like crackdown real estate full support modi continues these issues and not even bhakt ,Positive
 own confession rant goes here read your own expense for army surgical strike was the tipping point modi did took decision and popularized army have been doing such ops for long before but never advertise them because backlash was proud that something has been done although his fans spoiled crowning the day namo shaurya diwas and too many whatsapp forwards but decided vote bjp that day now comes demonetization was skeptical this from the day one but what the hell old notes will exchanged and new notes will come big deal modi will get some credit for doing something about but even after days still respite for common people and paisa netas are having 20lacs new notes the dangerous unpreparedness and short sighting before tinkering with already weak economy really criminal view and for what just get few votes this asshole have destroyed many lives ,Positive
the scope and graveness the mandate doesn allow for such lapses was dangerously reckless decision which doesn bode well for the remaining tenure too too have lost all faith the worst people are still gung about modi and basically invulnerable this point ,Negative

cheer modi comes out with another masterstroke demonetisation drags his blind supporters might actually turn him doesn people won suffer even more ,Neutral
since you mention the economist would like quote them from one their article politicians words particular change world and donald trump does not choose his politicians like promise action not words but this odd when was the last time political leader did anything important with physical action this was that action which politician were elected but the poor implementation and clear road map seems like they better only talk atleast gives sense that they act rather than acting like this where many suffer rbi doesn have enough space their press conf room for the economist and bbc staff per rbi they wanted have greater interaction with people present the conf room can blame them working smaller teams now what govt rbi the same thing now does ,Positive
 always liked modi better modi policies for the lack any better alternatives but understand that completely normal and natural that others might not like him his policies however cannot understand how someone can think him malicious surely even you disagree with his policy point view you have give him the credibility that doing everything the best interest nation from his standpoint has dynasty grow other apparent vested interests would happy have serious the point and kind answers ,Positive
you are correct there real opposition india right now congress joke any hope kindred the last time aap long lost but 2019 years away you can start building competition for modi 2019 bjp runs purely both urban and rural areas while might hard reach out the rural populace can least influence the netizans india shy away from any kind blind support towards anyone sincerely think doable the time campaign for 2019 starts find the right group people back think can find such group people just yesterday came know about the pirates india which sound interesting but that just first impression heck mere formal education might basic stuff like should vote for certain bad candidate just because from party should trust news etc,Positive

 cheer guys say something positive guess the best can come with that all the stars align this will end sooner than people think india own printing capacity currency quite low will take until spring you only use the presses the country the government hasn said anything about this but assume they also get help from abroad then this could end late january especially since you may not need replenish all cash that was the system since portion was black even most the black money has been laundered however this critically hinges them swallowing their pride and doing what best for the country they are too stubborn ask for help from the outside worse are too ignorant incompetent then will months and months this nevertheless must assume for own sanity that they did ask for help from foreign countries printing currency ,Positive

hell yes,Neutral
 with his level knowledge and education would able make poignant points ironic that you should have the confidence use words that you don know the meaning and question the ability seasoned politician working for decades hold conversation with another political leader ,Positive
this kind elitist led the victory trump people don want intellectuals lead they wan leader whom they can look and connect with them people can connect with modi because went from nobody india can inspire lot indians and you may believe not people actually like him and what stands for for the negotiations and talks you wrote about have many ministries full educated beareaucrats whose full time job discuss and execute these types things ,Positive
actually most the negotiations are done bureaucrats that true any country even even law professor like obama needs massive bureaucracy weigh every word any deal the qualifications for being are not exactly technical though technical knowledge least few areas helps the biggest requirements management providing political insulation policy makers and executioners and most importantly listening the experts that where the biggest problem with modi lies has massive ego probably believes himself avatar vishnu and doesn listen experts ,Positive
typical elitist indian mindset forget modi mms this conception that only degrees from cambridge oxford harvard maybe even iit allow you think and talk strategic intellectual level might from 500 years ago but akbar was illiterate theory but reality was total military and administrative genius contemporaries who interacted with him describe him man considerable erudition who had gained merely observing others and introspection one them monserrate said and paraphrsase nobody who did not know him illiterate would consider him anything but and went away thinking was very learned and erudite closer our time and home indira gandhi who did not even pass college and yet was spectacularly competent when came politics even interacting and building bridges with world leaders though nixon and kissinger hated her abraham lincoln had little formal education and was entirely self taught man and famously called his own education defective even closer our time jayalalitha was what 10th pass for all her faults she was extremely erudite voracious reader had near eidetic memory and amazing recall facts and figures otoh you have your own mms who was used toy somebody with next educational qualifications like said this has nothing with modi mms but this arrogant attitude that deems anybody who does not have degree from fancy college brain dead could and people who were not only remarkably successful but would extremely smart and erudite despite even not having basic education why john glenn who died recently after such stellar career college dropout read churchill biography was aside from some brief flashes utterly shitty student and ironically for one the most powerful orators human history massive stutterer also like abe was pretty much self taught man this post seems inspired kejriwal tweets and the irony that someone who has decent academic record paper one the most brain dead asinine conniving assholes the indian political scene right now who talks shit and that something ,Positive
 just like make point that dropped out college and highest qualification high school still considered expert several subjects and experience field sees regularly get interviewed channels and print media written articles for several publications and acknowledged peers their equal the point not having let alone ground for judging anyone capabilities use experience always look out for people who are interested improving themselves and learning more rather than those who have impeccable credentials but are dumb can speak about the because never had conversation with him but judging from his body language you dead wrong you think not smart and that can hold his own against obama trudeau ,Positive
redditors whole are funny people live echo chamber made their own thoughts and whatever they want believe anyone who taking the yes nos here and projecting them how elections are gonna unravel plain silly look trump and how the opinion redditors was about him and how all media houses opinion polls exit polls were showing low chance him winning was bad anyone who was trump supporter was just afraid come out they would branded racist whatnot feel like same happening public about modi people are afraid they speak against modi bjp they will branded anti national pakistani aapiya aaptard khangresi etc they just keep their opinions now atleast public like how happened delhi elections every media house was replaying clips bjp leaders shiela dixit making fun kejriwal the narrative whole they were pushing was kejriwal just joke contender will lose seats max disregard him same was reflected opinion exit polls then results came aap made govt for days after that news channels again went offensive against aap about how people now know aap not serious and this time they will vote bjp for clear majority they got prepare get surprised all saying haven even seen this demonetization thing settle down yet and how going affect economy next two years outlook gloomy though ,Negative
yes ,Neutral
 how does that affect india image the world community you care more about the perception than reality itself none you gave fuck about the lack toilets and open defecation the past decade until poo the loo meme came actually tackle your point you are working under the false assumption that world leaders are the one who hold technical discussions that universities make you informed worldly matters obama struggles give speeches without teleprompter despite being professor contradicting your own idea higher education ,Positive
 with his level knowledge and education would able make poignant points bit elitist suggest lack education makes someone dunce vice versa for instance wharton alumnus donald trump thinks climate change chinese hoax the other hand remember rapporteurs tweeting during the climate change summit that modi was one the better informed politicians letterman was likewise complementary about modi understanding the issues the nat geo documentary the demonetization farce shows modi far from infallible but comes across well informed ,Positive
fuck yes till bjp has congress mukt bharat their goal they just have deliver greater than performance for them get vote ,Positive
 would think yes modi has been very perceptive about the concerns the younger generation has emphasized the movement towards digitalization cashless society and social media things that destroy the old know someone jugaadi network the older generation and instead make things more transparent fair and empowering average middle class ambitious tech savvy youngster the other hand has rolled back and emphasized the more worrisome aspects right wing including attacking minorities attacking women sexual moral policing lgbt attacks etc happy that the whole muslims gays feminists atheists westerners and valentine day are threat akhand aryabhumi and need eliminated rhetoric has piped down and modi has kept suppressed from top down yeah seems good candidate uptil now only reservations about him are foreign policy ucc and lack media interviews ,Positive

interesting question and suprisingly think modi and obama became very good friends the last g20 summit after the photo session chinese tried converse with obama but obama fully ignored him and made bee line for modi they both hugged and started talking like good friends their friendship seemed very genuine keeping mind that both are different one tea seller and other graduate columbia and harvard ,Positive

 honestly don care much for politician education btw trudeau commentary was pretty basic introductionary description that you can riff from wikipedia obama and merkel are different league however all the education the world doesn prevent you from doing stupid shit even the smartest person has rely advisors and technocrats argue that more important trait wisdom knowing your own limits modi doesn know his own limits which see now but equally someone highly intelligent could end arrogant self congratulatory echo chamber where they don consult with anyone because they are wedded the idea their own excellence therefore looking someone education alone fairly poor indicator how someone will view your character values and wisdom matters more course intelligence still important but less for national leader than people think ,Positive
advisors the prime minister solo god all leaders have team hand picked advisory board help them with making tough decisions what really sets apart good leaders from great ones how they heed the advices they receive ,Positive
international politics not complicated you are making out gaining adequate amount knowledge these matters does not take more than few months for individual and you can bet modi has excellent team advisors help him out like ceos getting their smartest employees summarise books and reports you not need spend years and years learning the academic details strong grasp the basics enough function productively plus for all their educational qualifications the politicians you mentioned haven been strong leaders obama america highly divided and discontent merkel germany under assault from immigrants and she turning blind eye manmohan didn squat the years was given especially when was good finance minister ,Positive
yes unlike most vocal randians seeing that government actually trying reform tax system plus other countless initiatives and foreign policies ,Positive
yes you are right but does not matter much leaders nations would always prefer someone they can communicate with directly and clearly the same intellectual level and high educational standards and good exposure national politics and international diplomacy well proficiency global topics help when clinton called vajpayee during kargil there were reports that only clinton spoke and there was response from vajpayee did not get clinton accent who knows but what matters those levels the end not your own knowledge but whether you can summon the knowledge specialists for purpose and whether you truly have the power act promises you make for knowledge bureaucrats are brought for accent diplomats take over serious discussions the would revert hindi gujarati expect that perfectly fine there are translators get right for comprehension bureaucrats listen provide the answer based what they know what the wants and their answers are accepted the answer the and for modi ability act his word negotiations that not doubt far international negotiations modi with great mandate and that balances out his inability grasp complexities problem really not there modi not known tolerate dissenting opinions but what extent does absolutely refuse have bureaucrats found ways tell him that not right has removed those bureaucrats from top positions smart enough keep the unlikeable ones does get the right kind advice not these are questions which won have answer for long long time ,Positive

does the really need explanation many years ago after the godhra carnage vir sanghvi former editor the hindustan times made once lifetime confession about how the indian media reports communal violence details aspx key 611 the answer suspect that are programmed see hindu muslim relations simplistic terms hindus provoke muslims suffer when this formula does not work clear now that well armed muslim mob murdered unarmed hindus simply not know how cope shy away from the truth that some muslims committed act that indefensible and resort blaming the victims course there are always ‘rational reasons’ offered for this stand muslims are minority and therefore they deserve special consideration muslims already face discrimination why make harder for them you report the truth then you will inflame hindu sentiments and this would irresponsible and this something most indian journalists believe but few would ever admit public forum because they know not morally justifiable view outside their ideological circle that why sanghvi was widely attacked his profession when wrote this article and not just journalists but most indian public figures who talk about interfaith and communal issues they follow these same compromises their secular idealogy mainly political construct not true secularism and hence there implicit agreement compromise when comes what they see lesser evils like muslim fundamentalists non bjp parties pandering such fundamentalists they see their duty remain silent about even support such people for the sake what they see more important goal fight the sangh parivar majoritarianism the name secularism they condone communalism ,Positive

the buddha allowed monastics eat meat was not seen heard etc this wasn directed lay people though and there really isn anything directed lay people the theravada school for monastics very different the time they would begging for their food and what they would get would usually the left overs people food this entirely different from the meat industry today people who site this verse have completely failed consider the context for the logic rather simple how can you practice non violence towards other beings you supporting industry that kills living beings that people can enjoy their flesh people wouldn with this were humans being killed but have been culturally influenced with the case animals might make sense for christians for example who believe that humans were given dominion over animals but not for buddhists for whom all sentient beings are equal being sentient beings think buddhists who eat meat and think justified really haven given proper thought what exactly they justifying restaurants and see monks there ordering beef and all that and just makes realise more and more how far people have strayed from the dharma ,Positive
very clearly keep these two topics apart know group called red buddha and they say they are socialdemocrats and buddhists find this extremely dangerous making the dharma opinion something course killing bad lying bad etc nevertheless not make the dharma argument sociopolitical arguments you want cultivate compassion the way you should not really look the animals that are being killed you should look the butcher and burst with compassion this argument has not been brought forth the discussion the other day buddhists not pity the suffering creature they are pitying the one who does the negative action ,Negative
